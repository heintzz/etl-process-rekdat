2023-11-15,I would still recommend this to most especially since online only isnt a huge deal for a vast majority of players unless you were sold on it from the start with false promises which I can totally understand.

2023-11-15,"TLDR: Fun with friends, frustrating mechanics, bad game company. Is the game fun with friends? Sure. But this game is enraging. I didn't have any expectations coming into the game so unlike most the reviews, I don't care about the loot boxes that much or lack of offline mode but it seems like big corporation screwed over loyal backers. My problem with this game lies with some of the mechanics. The maps without a insta-kill zone are extremely inconsistent. For example the gas map I will watch some people spend 5 to 10 seconds slowly getting back to the platform and survive. This precedes to happen 4 times and the person still survives. Meanwhile I had a match where about 3 seconds into the match I was thrown in the gas and preceded to die seemingly instantly. Along with this, the hit registration is inconsistent as well. I will watch my powered up punches slam into someones face 4 times with no knockout, then get one hit by something that didn't even look like it hit me. Also the power punch is only thrown from the right hand which is a small detail that I think should change as there are many times I wish he would just throw the left hand instead. Most people would boil this down to skill issue which is fine, its my review, and I prefer my games to have a sense of control and consistency which this game completely lacks. If you don't care about that than yeah the game is great fun. My last grievance is that once you reach lvl 100, I don't see a way to gain nemo bucks which means your only option is to buy their premium currency to buy loot boxes to hope to get the skin you want. For a 20 dollar game, this business practice is pathetic. The amount of nemo bucks you earn from leveling up and achievements just isnt enough to get the skins you want and they know that. They just want you to spend more money to gamble and hopefully find the skin you want.",24.2,0

Whereas most local multiplayer games are basically connect the controllers and go.,0.5,0
2023-11-07,"I want to like this game I really do. but it's getting harder the longer I play it. Things like inconsistent gameplay elements like the poison on Ichiban or the cold in Winter Is Coming. The combat in general is VERY inconsistent which can be funny at times, but other times you are instantly punched in the face and get tossed off the edge for half of the match or even the whole match. Frequent AFKers especially in team based matches like Into The Game or any sport map. It just wears away at me making it hard to play for more than a few matches per sitting.",37.5,0

2023-11-04,"For the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease 2 8-inch round cake pans. Line with parchment paper, then butter/spray with cooking a medium size bowl combine the flour, sugar, unsweetened cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Set the bowl of a stand mixer (or use a hand held mixer) beat together the eggs, buttermilk, greek yogurt, canola oil and vanilla until smooth.Slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients with the mixer on low until there are no longer any clumps of flour. Add the hot coffee and mix until combined. Batter should be pourable, but not super thin. Stir in the chocolate chips, if using.Pour the batter among the 2 cake pans and bake 20 to 25 minutes, until the tops are just set and no longer wiggly in the center. Remove and let cool five minutes, then run a knife around the edges of the pan. Grab 2 large flat plates, line them with wax or parchment paper and invert the cakes onto the paper lined plates. Cover and let the cakes cool completely before frosting.For the Frosting: Add the butter and powdered sugar to the bowl of a stand mixer (or use a hand held mixer). Beat the butter and powdered sugar together until the butter is light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add the cocoa powder and vanilla and beat, scrapping down the sides as needed another 2 minutes or until there are no streaks of white. Add 3 tablespoons of the heavy cream and whip the frosting for 2-4 minutes or until light and fluffy. If desired add the remaining tablespoon of the heavy cream (I normally do) and whip until combined. Taste the frosting and add more powdered sugar if you like a sweeter or thicker frosting.Place 1 layer, flat side up, on a plate or cake stand. With a knife or offset spatula, spread the top with frosting. Place the second layer on top, rounded side up, and spread the frosting evenly on the top and sides of the cake. Decorate with sprinkles, chocolate curls or whatever your heart desires. *To quickly bring eggs to room temperature place them in a bowl and fill with warm water. Let them sit five minutes.",8.8,1

2023-11-01,"This game is a literal spam fest. Once I'm knocked out, I can spam as much as I want until my controller breaks, while not waking up whatsoever. The knockout system is so unbalanced and annoying to deal with, especially when you can get knocked out from almost anything. Nunchucks are also completely unfair and busted, I can count on one hand how many times I've seen someone knock themselves out with them. Game can be fun, but there is just so much bs in it.",39.7,0

2023-11-01,"I really enjoy the game and have continuously played it. I am still a beginner but would love to learn more about the abilities. Also, some players seem to continue to knock out players using tools. These players don't even get a chance to wake up and get up to defend themselves as they get knocked out immediately as soon as they wake up since these opponents just wait for them to wake up. This could be annoying and unfun. Besides this the game is really fun. I like to grind so I can get more cosmetics.",23.3,1

The game needs a knockout ring timer or some form of understanding as to why there's so much inconsistency with knockouts. This inconsistency spreads elsewhere, one second I'm tossing someone in the ice and they swim for a good 3 seconds, climb up, get knocked down in the water and are able to climb out once more, then if I get pushed off within those 3 seconds I'm froze, there are many examples of this and it makes the game very unfun when at its core it's a pretty enjoyable party game with some really fun games, but it's just too much, maybe in future updates......but I have a weird feeling that this is something that'll remain very much the same game with no major QoL changes or updates made but I'd like to be wrong and I'd like to change my review if those things happen along with it.",54.5,0

2023-10-28,"At first I was hesitant spending $20 on a game from a new Dev team and also seeing the negative reviews. Do NOT listen to the negative reviews. This is gang beast on steroids. No pay for skins bs (like alot of games nowadays), you unlock skins, bones and dollars so fast it actually gives you the ability to use the item shop without having to spend irl money. Playing online is really great, haven't faced any connection issues. The game mechanics are great, not perfect, but still really good. 2 minute timeout makes sense. You leave a game YOU started, you are gonna get a timeout. If you can't wait 2 mins you need to learn how to have patience. Solid game worth the $20. Split screen is a little wonky, I won't lie but this is the early 2000's with LAN parties anymore. I get the complaint but it still works. Solid game all around 8.3/10",25.9,1

This is clearly going to be free to play once the hype has died down and the player base is in the hundreds. Only paid for it so i could collect ye al mighty Twitch skin on the cute black cat, ill take that as a ""i paid for the skin and not the game"" moment. Cause if it wasn't for the drop ""expiring"" on 11/11/23 i would have just waited for the inevitable FTP model coming out within a year :) Theres a reason this game was ""mostly negative"" for a while when it first came out, it wasn't only because of the crap servers or poor friend invite system.

2023-10-25,"The game is absolutely better than Gang Beasts in some ways and worse in some ways. Overall if you really love animals and how cutesy they can be go for this game, it's killer. It's just as difficult if not more difficult to actually win at this game (or I probably have a skill issue and I always manage to get knocked out) this game is not for people with a short fuse.

The climbing, grabbing, throwing, and punching mechanics are all luck based and make no sense whatsoever. The timing and execution of any command is AI generated.

2023-10-24,"This is a party game, no DRM, and you will be laughing your fuzzy animal butt off with this one. It's like what happens after a Mario party game, but the focus is the fight, but it is sooo silly and colorful that I love every minute of it. It is pure chaos and I love every second of it. Get the delux, support the devs, this is just pure funny.",16.6,1
2023-10-24,"This is by far the best 20 bucks I've spent on steam in the past year. An actual complete game, no bugs, beautiful UI, amazing mechanics, and adorable avatars. Everyone complaining about the offline play don't understand what it means to write a review for the game. People are so unforgiving for smaller companies its kind of infuriating especially when AAA games like MWIII come out and its an exact reskin of the previous. Party Animals was worth the wait 100% especially if you have friends to play with, don't listen to the haters, they play COD.",82.6,1
2023-10-24,Party Animals is super fun. One of the best things about the game is that you can take it however seriously you want. It can be pretty competitive but if you just want to goof around and have fun you can do that too.,31.3,1

2023-10-23,"A very fun party game with friends. It's severely over-hated here on Steam. There are in-game purchases, which is a common complaint, but there is a very good reward system built into the game and a ""battle pass"" structure for players. Plenty of achievement based rewards and weekly/daily challenges to complete for XP and in-game currency. The mechanics of the game are fun as well, with a good variety of mini games/game modes in rotation. It's an E for Everyone game with a really unique art style that I really enjoy playing in a party with my buddies.

2023-10-21,"All around, it's a great game with pretty decent replayability and brings out a bunch of laughs. Unfortunately, it seems like the devs really just do not care about the community's interests. Local Play is a mediocre experience with huge frame drops when using split screen (split screen already being a HUGE disappointment), the obvious predatory features like loot boxes/gacha/insane in-game currency prices in general, and there's no visible road-map provided on any of the game's social media pages; there really hasn't been any notable updates, besides minor bug fixes, within the month that it has been out. This game has a potential to be REALLY great considering it has such a vibrant artstyle and well-constructed maps, but it can be SO much better if the devs can manage to unplug their ears to hear the community.",10.3,1

It lets you stack their team and do 4 vs 2 for example, you can turn off weapons, etc. The only downside is you pretty much have to use real $$$ for skins.

2023-10-18,If you are a competitive person this game isn't for you as you have pretty much no control over what happens to you in a match. Match making is ridiculously long and the quick match games are even longer. It is super flawed and kills the joy of playing the game after one match because it took 15 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ rounds. Also in this case of wanting to quit a ridiculous match you get punished. Great idea to expand on gang beast and push it further but the fools that made this have no understanding of the overall design and features,7.1,0

My son got this game for his birthday from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.",24.8,1

2023-10-17,"This game is lots of fun with friends. Reviews had me worried about the monetization model, but the in-game currency is super easy to obtain. I already have a collection of cute skins from leveling up and completing achievements. There's plenty of toxicity in voice chat, but that's pretty easy to disable (not sure why open mic is on by default?) Also, I hope the people who want an offline mode eventually get that, but, for me personally, I don't have much of a need for it. If that's a concern of yours, maybe hold off of buying. Overall, I think the game's worth it if you enjoy online party games and general low-stakes fun.

2023-10-15,point blank the game is fun. people are hating on the fun either cuz they suck or because their parents never gave them a hug. maybe the theory is they just dont have friends to play with ? ahh who cares it has voice chat and text chat if they keep it updated enough with content it should live a while,50.7,1
2023-10-15,This game is just pure hilarious fun. If you were a fan of the game Gang Beasts then you will love this game. cannot praise this game enough. my only gripe is that it does not run very well on the steam deck when a game as small as this should run pretty well in my opinion. hopefully future updates might address that.,12.1,1

2023-10-14,Very fun game with fun fighting with cute animals. I hope to see more maps and more furry friends to come along. This game does not deserve mixed reviews it is a good game. Many people don’t like it because you have to have internet to play and cannot play without. I do not think this is a problem at all since all you have to do is just make a private lobby and you can play with family and friends and almost everybody has internet. Also people say that their are micro transactions but this is not true at all because all of the currency can be earned totally free with the free battle-pass-like reward system. Another problem people don’t like about it is that when their are two players it is split screen. My honest review is that people shouldn’t have such high expectations for game that just barely released and shouldn’t be rating this game a bad review because this game is still in an early stage. The devs have been updating this game very often and if they keep doing so this game won’t come to a sad ending.,37.3,1

Game constantly stops responding mid game and crashing or crashing on the winning screen causing me to have to reopen if I want to attempt to play and not have it repeat crash. Also between crashing and the keyboard controls being garbage forcing you to use controller and the controller handling being delayed the game is unplayable. Feels bad trying to play with friends that I played Gang Beasts with to not have it work. At least Gang Beasts didn't crashes a thousand times.",2.6,0
2023-10-12,"AMAZING GAME!! Fun filled laughs with your friends in this rag-doll based physics game with cute animals in chaotic outfits! Definitely worth playing with multiple friends... though, solo is also a blast. Highly recommended to party with friends - don't pass up on this gem!",16.9,1

2023-10-12,Having just one NA server just doesn't cut it with a game like this. I have a solid connection but when I select a server at start it's not great. There's a reason most games have US West and ES East. I don't know where the server is but it's not near me.,21.0,0

2023-10-09,"The game has been getting slammed for not having an offline mode (despite literally saying so) and for having an awkward split screen for a literal party game. The devs responded by saying they don't plan on including this in the future. You would think that since first impressions are mixed, they would want to address what the early adopters are saying they don't like; but no. Instead, they essentially said ""We don't care about you. What you're asking for is less likely to cause FOMO and we're greedy.""",0.8,0

2023-10-09,This game is great. Microtransactions are just cosmetic. If it keeps the developers making new content then I'm all for it. I don't get why people ♥♥♥♥♥ about microtransactions if it isn't pay to win. I'd rather it be a 19.99 game with microtransactions for cosmetics than a 59.99 game with all skins. I been playing for only 9 hours and never spent a single penny and already unlocked a lot of uncommon/rare skins just by leveling up and using the in game currency awarded to me for free. Only downside is its not a couch coop game and and its online only. If you have discord friends to play with then its a no-brainer to buy this game. If you're only looking for an offline-experience then I'd wait till that becomes a thing. Feel free to add me if you'd like to join me and friends play :D,14.4,1
2023-10-09,"So in all reality I can only say, the game is not worth the 18$ price tag, it isnt even worth a 5$ price tag in its current state. If they want to insist on a premium currency in the store that they force FOMO on and include lootboxes they should make the game f2p. if they want to keep the price tag put all skins in a shop for premium currency and have the rotation one solely use the cookies to buy skins from and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ gacha should NOT be premium and instead be cookies again.",65.7,0

2023-10-08,"If you're looking for some dumb fun with whacky ragdoll mechanics, this is it. The microtransactions are only cosmetic, so you aren't missing out on gameplay by not paying. However, after a few hours of playing, the game does get repetitive. It's all just minigames, most of which will be voted to be last man standing. The game could use some balancing of points for different team sizes at the end of the match, and literally ANY free-for-all games where you're not in a team, but that's just me.",19.5,1

Not even to mention no offline local play, I typically play these couch games with my siblings and we still suffer from it despite having fiber internet and amazing connection with every other game. So I cant play with my buds online, or my bros offline, just a bad call from the devs. Also no I will not pay for cosmetics on a 20 dollar party game.

2023-10-07,"This game is fun. I will say that the toxicity is pretty bad but look at other games. No multi-player game has no toxicity. The game is perfect to play with friends and is full of funny moments to have. Only thing I think the developers need to work on is a restriction on the items that you can swing around to knock out your opponents. I feel like there should be a re-load on them. Besides that, the game is a 8/10",22.3,1

2023-10-07,"After just buying a new PC with what I'd consider to be pretty good specs (NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050, AMD Ryzen 5 5600 6-Core Processor and 16GB of RAM), I fully expected this game to run at no less than 60 FPS, which wasn't the case at all. After around 30 minutes of consistent gameplay, the FPS dropped so slow (around a 5-10 FPS mark) to the extent that it became unplayable. Another few noteworthy inconsistencies would be the gameplay mechanics altogether, i.e punching, grabbing, throwing. Everything just seems so tedious and luck based to the point where it doesn't feel rewarding at all when you win games, it's almost as if the only way to successfully execute an intended action is to pray to the luck gods that your character decides to align properly to the exact correct molecule. It's like controlling a boneless corpse. Not to mention the weapon spawns too. Why is it fair that one player with a shovel or nun-chucks can knock other players out in seconds? That way the game just becomes a race to get a weapon and practically become unstoppable. I recall being able to keep a player knocked out on the ground almost permanently by just spamming the headbutt control, rendering them useless for the majority of the match. One unintended press of a button and it could be the reason for a loss. Keeping in mind the target audience for this game is likely younger children, I can imagine that it's perhaps unfair to judge a family type party game on control consistency, but it's no secret that older audiences play this game too. Not to mention that this game costs actual MONEY with very minimal maps and game modes to play on as well as an army's worth of in-game purchases that can be made for a pretty excessive price in my opinion. This game is in NO way worth it's price, nor is it worth playing alone (or on a decent PC for some reason?). There is an extensive amount of teamwork based modes in this game too, which I found to be unpleasant when being paired with literal children that had absolutely no idea what they were doing, making winning almost impossible when almost every single match I participated in, I HAD to have a teammate. Overall, if you're looking for a funny party game where you beat people up, buy Gang Beasts.",5.2,0

2023-10-05,"I recommend this game more than Gang Beats personally, it's very fun to play by yourself or even just custom games with friends. Lots of outfits and animals to choose from as well. The game is very generous with giving outfits and in game currency even if you prefer not to spend money on it either.",11.7,1

2023-10-05,"Its so fugin cute, please don't hate on it. The connection is more than fine. Only critique I would have is the number of maps available for pvp, would like it if there were more maps available, or at least more interactive maps. The item shop doesn't make so much sense, it seems you have to spend quite a lot of money but it only really matters if you're concerned about aesthetics, of which the animals are already so cute themselves.",5.8,1
2023-10-05,"The controls are awful with the punches being the worst of them all sometimes hitting yourself because the physics engine decides your punch should go backwards. Half the time you die to the games awful hit detection and de-sync. And the lack of diversity having pretty much the same game modes aside from the sport themed levels. It just gets repetitive and boring, each level can be devolved into punch pick up throw into pit. Just makes for an all around bad party game experience",3.5,0

2023-10-05,the game could be so much better with a better camera system and better control over your punches. Game is plagued by not being able to hit people that are literally kissing your fist/foot. Pets cannot seem to grab with 2 hands when you need them to and prioritize grabbing walls over other players.,10.6,0
2023-10-05,Really fun party game that you can play for either a quick 5 minute adventure or all evening. Be prepared to put friendships to the test as a well meaning punch to the enemy could also mean sweet chin music to your buddys. Definitely recommend,69.6,1
2023-10-05,"I will be honest with ya, Before the game released and it was pre-test, I played it on the first time. First it was pretty nice with 5 maps but I knew its not worth almost 20$! so i refunded it, After 2 weeks when the game released fully, I bought it again to see if the game really worth just for 20 maps, After playing a while I thought its nice and didn't refund it which was the biggest mistake i would do. This game is nice for some days but after its just boring and I actually regrading not refunding it on the first place. This game just isn't what i expected for those kind of money and that much years of waiting, I wouldn't recommend you to waste that much money for this kind of game.",5.2,0

If you like physics based zany wacky nonsensical fun, and are also good at games, this game is for you. I will say there some sweaty people who play this, but if you can beat them, the extra challenge and higher level of game play mixed with the random physics is fun.

It feels bad to lose a game because the game decides you're gonna die. The game also needs more mini games and maps. Out of all the games, I probably only like half of them because the other half are either not fun or can be cheesed by others and the good old rng. Sadly the bad outweighs the good so i cannot recommend in this state.",14.0,0

I didnt know how badly i needed such a game to come into my life. You see, I suffer from a lot of illnesses, you name it - i got it. Anyway, this game became a runaway escape to a vast new reality, away from all my illnesses. I didnt have the stress of doctors running in and out of my hospital room, giving me organ and blood transplants, no... this game was a whole new dimension for me. It wasnt just a game anymore, it was the reason I was saved. I played and played party animals and slowly the doctors noticed I got better. Not long after, I had mildly healed from most of my illnesses, and soon after, I didnt have them anymore. I slowly looked to my screen with the lobby screen of Party Animals, a tear shed from my eye. I impulsively hugged the screen as tears ran down my face, ""Party Animals"" I cried, ""Thank you so much..."". Party Animals had saved my life. I was free.

Yes, some skins are locked behind a currency, but i have been able to acquire any skin i liked, without paying, but by playing. grind enough games, and you can get your skins.

2023-10-01,"However, I am not liking the voting in quick match to pick a game and I play quick match more than anything. It's constantly the same games over and over and it's getting boring pretty quick. Please just get rid of the voting and have it randomized or something. TBH in the voting there's only the same to vote on as well. There are so many maps and I only really ever see 4 of them. A daily challenge would be fun too instead of just the weekly. Challenges make a game more fun, having to wait a week is meh for something like that to reset is no fun.",32.4,1
2023-10-01,"This game sucks. Everything is 50/50. I will hit a player with the most gut wrenching punch only for it to do ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and have them knock me out with the weakest tap possible. Another stupidly unreliable mechanic is the grabbing system. Sometimes you pick things up, sometimes you don't. Even when I take a good 5 seconds to try and pick up an item, I end up grabbing it with one hand (does not let you use the item if this happens), or I don't grab it at all. Same with trying to throw people off the map. Sometimes you can pick them up, sometimes you can't. It is incredibly frustrating. Some items are just completely broken and will eliminate players with the slightest touches (nun-chucks). Also, the kill feed options (log, banana, bomb), they are all super delayed when you click them and its again, another 50/50 shot, on whether the item you have chosen even lands on the map or gets flung off entirely. I was hoping to have fun whilst playing this game, but I only found myself angry after every match. Seriously, do not get this. Refunded after 2 hours.",9.7,0

But within 30 minutes while playing, the more you'll see everything is the same with a different name or object to throw or drag around. The same goes for Duo mode. Throw some one off of X to win, same concept for all those mini-games but comes around to becoming the same thing overall. Hitting enemies is very wonky, you're going to miss a lot and you'll never be able to hit the AI at all, but they'll own you like it's nothing. I can hit my friends easily, but when it comes to hitting the AI, nope. My friends and I did everything in two hours. Yes, we laughed a lot, that's what counts; but, I cannot recommend this because it's one of those games you'll play once and never play again. No replayability value at all.",2.0,0

2023-09-30,"Wow, anyone giving this game a bad review either have no friends to play with or are completely full of s***. This game is fantastic fun. I can maybe understand being upset about your server ping. It's not a high budget game so I'm sure server allocation isn't exactly something they could just spring for world wide like COD. Would be nice to have an app or way for you to figure out if your server ping is good in your relocation prior to buying the game but them's the breaks. Those folks, I genuinely feel for. But everyone else b**ching about the microtransactions ... bruh, you're are acting like this game f**ked your girl and made you watch. I get it, no one wants microtransactions in a game they paid full price for, but this developer also isn't making it a pay to win scenario or anything other than, ""if you don't want to wait and earn it, here's a shop."" How about you calm your t*ts a bit, resist the urge to buy anything and have some fun, Nancy?",7.2,1

2023-09-30,8/10 Its a BLAST! Specially when I play with my kids xD,26.1,1
2023-09-30,"I don’t write many reviews, but I’ve really enjoyed this game so far. Have had a lot of fun with my brother. It’s basically gang beasts but 100x better. I understand the complaints but those don’t really apply to me so in my opinion for a party game I’d give this a 10/10, as a game in general I’d say it’s a like an 7.5/10 as of now. Just thought I’d make this review since the game is being bombed with negative reviews. Try this game out, you won’t regret it.",83.5,1
2023-09-30,All these negative reviews complaining about 'no offline play' do you just... not have access to wifi or something? and that's why ur complaining? I don't get it. You can still make private custom games who cares if u need internet. What's the big whoop? Saddos review bombing,12.1,1

2023-09-30,"Another great thing about Party Animals is that it's a really social game. You can play with your friends, either online or in the same room, and it's always a blast. You'll laugh a lot and probably tease each other too. Plus, you can also meet new friends or rivals by jumping into public matches with strangers. And the best part is that the game is easy to pick up and play, so anyone can join in on the fun, regardless of their gaming experience.",22.1,1

2023-09-30,"Don't listen to the negative reviews of this game, it is not predatory, the micro transactions are all purely cosmetic and have no effect on the game play. It's far less predatory than a ""free"" game like Fortnite where you have to pay upwards of 20$ PER skin. This game does allow you to purchase skins yes, but a very large portion of the skins can be EARNED without that much grind. Just play the game and have fun and you'll definitely get a skin you like. Also buying skins is way cheaper than most competitors. It's a great game to play with friends, really fun once you get the hang of the controls.",23.7,1
2023-09-30,Not my cup of tea. Feels like a less fun gang beasts. Definitely felt pretty competitive if that's what you're looking for. Wasn't the goofy type of fun gang beasts was. Also why is it automatically set to open mic all chat?,0.3,0

2023-09-30,"while i do like this game and it is fun there are so many things wrong with it, i love the fighting but man you stay knocked out for too long, and dying can happen in such bs ways its infuriating, then the shooting stuff when your dead takes so long to load and impossible to aim its not worth, map votes get so rigged you should be able to queue for only certain ones or at least make the vote pool bigger, also games can go on for so many rounds and you can win two rounds and knock out so many people but if another team clutches in round 8 after 20 mins you get the same rewards as any other team who zero wins, rewards should be based on performance not just final score, it makes a 20 min game feel like a waste of time even if you won 2 rounds, the monetization also blows you should get an egg token after every level up, make me actually want to keep playing",20.8,1
2023-09-30,"Super good game i love it it just needs some more time, and it will be perfect for anyone",6.9,1
2023-09-30,"I HIGHLY recommend this game. Some friends and I bought it to try out together and when I tell you I haven't laughed this hard in YEARS. The controls have a bit of a learning curve, but if you've played games like Gang Beasts you'll pick it up quickly. I also love that there are a lot of different game types so it never gets stale. When you get tired of last one standing you can play some football/soccer or other goal-oriented games. Not only am I thrilled with the purchase of this game, I'm also excited for the possibilities of future additions to come.",27.8,1

Games a joke and this trend of games that are paid for and hiding skins behind paywalls is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ obscene and im sick of it. Gaming is truly dead. Developers make more and more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ games for more money and less game. The pure randomness of the mechanics of this game are a joke. Dont even get me started about team games. There is no way to filter out these games they are in the map pool no matter what unless you choose a custom game. You should be able to choose if you wanna play the rumble mode or the team mode. It is insanely frustrating when you get a team game and the teams are just stacked. This game needs to serious work put into it until it can be considered a good game. It is fun and wacky but the cons out way the pros at the moment. Wait for it to go on sale so you can just play it with some buddies because thats where this game truly shines. Also, let me add there is no anti-cheat for this game. So, there are a lot of cheaters. Add anti-cheat. Get rid of the stupid ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ balloon game mode. It is actual garbage. Update, game still sucks, same issues same problems. I dont see them getting fixed anytime soon.",65.8,0

Not a lot of foresight in the design decisions on display here and I'm not going to be spending any money on their microtransactions, I give the community a couple months until there's only extreme fans whining about why there's no new players coming to try the game.",9.4,0

2023-09-29,"Personally I like this game a lot. It's fun, relatively casual, the music is nice as are the graphics. I see that there are some problems, like the confusion around offline gameplay lack of servers in some places resulting in high ping, and I hope for these issues to get resolved in the future, even if they didn't actually intend for offline play to be in the game. I play from Siberia, where pings are usually not the best but for this game everything works very well. Being in Australia with a high ping or expecting offline playing capabilities I might have left a negative review since its actually a big deal, but the game is still relatively good and fun, which are most of what I'd want from a game nowadays to be honest.",34.8,1

2023-09-28,"The gameplay is somewhat annoying for me. I'm in the middle east and the European server is the best one for me to connect to, which puts me at a ping of 150+. While it doesn't cause much trouble, sometimes it does not allow me to play properly. I can barely hit other players and I'm easily knocked out. Also, the lag and input latency makes it harder to control the character as desired. I hope a middle eastern server gets added.",19.8,1
2023-09-28,"Very good and fun gameplay especially with friends. There are micro transactions but its only for skins, which you start off with plenty and you can earn skins through the battlepass (free to everyone), achievements, and there's codes that they release for skins! I can basically tell you nothing bad about this game that would make it deserve a negative review. Yes, people are upset at the micro transactions, from someone who didn't spend any real money for the in-game money, i've earned over 30 skins/outfits with roughly 40 hours of gameplay. This game is 110% worth the $20 and the people leaving negative reviews because of the micro transactions have no more than a couple hours played and just want all the skins asap.

2023-09-27,Rating of game: I give it a solid 7/10 just because it’s so fun with friends but when you are paired up with a stranger disconnecting or who doesn’t really know what they are doing and throwing you off when you are teammates can be frustrating. I feel they should have it if you are intentionally throwing off teammates or killing them constantly to be warned for the behavior. Accidents can happen so it would have to truly be monitored on how they are acting to have the system warn them.,16.8,1

2023-09-27,"This game is a ton of fun! It's like the Mario Party minigames you couldn't get enough of as a kid, but floppy and with animals. I'm not the biggest fan of the monetization, but I do feel the value of the game is worth it. There are tons of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to unlock via leveling up, completing achievements, and the currency you do eventually earn by continuing to play. Overall, I love the game a lot, and hope people can look past the monetization for some of the most fun I've had in a hot minute.",25.9,1
2023-09-27,Game is already toxic. shouldn't be able to hit teammates. People can queue on diff teams and allow wins that way. theres no pause on start so some people can start quicker and knock you out at the very start of the match. Friendly fire is toxic and needs to be disabled. The mechanics are too loose to be have such a precise consequence,26.1,0
2023-09-27,"Hours of very silly fun. The currency you can buy is able to be earned through the free battle-pass by levelling, there are also many quality skins you can obtain with the purely free currency (biscuits) so the countless negative reviews over micro-transactions are honestly a little unfair. The developers have done a good job of providing content to play for. The game is best enjoyed with friends, or a duo at least but is still a lot of fun solo.",104.2,1

2023-09-27,I ended up getting a refund. Yeah the game is quiet funny and very silly but you soon get bored and becomes very repetitive.

It is quite funny, any K.O hit is absolutely brutal, me and my friends can have countless hours of fun playing either quick match or customs. The biggest gripe for me though, is the achievements. Some of them are simply easily or a nice little challenge to get...I know some games make these achievements a grind to get so you feel some sense of gratification, a game like this however, i don't feel as should have such hard achievements. Most to all require you to do it in quick match which you can go in with a party of 4 to make your life a little easier, but to get 4-7 other people to either cooperate, or k.o so you can then go for them is quite difficult, hell its hard enough as it is to get friends to not throw anything or knock each other out. The one achievement has you survive on a plane that ices over and you have to survive 2:30, and even when you get the people to cooperate, that challenge is damn near impossible. I just hope they tweak the achievements at least a little bit...Other than that the game is very fun overall 7/10.",28.2,1

2023-09-26,"I've been following the development of this game since the very start when it was codenamed 'Happy Happy Nemo'. I was so glad when it was officially announced and I was hyped to buy and play it. Until I was met with a quick match that was restricted to teams only, no 8-man Free-For-Alls, instead, I got 2v2v2v2 and let's face it. Who is playing this game solo to play teams. I get the game is supposed to be played with friends and all that but the game should be able to be fun without them. The fact that you can't change the quick match search settings and are stuck to voting for a mode which will ALWAYS BE TEAMS (2v2v2v2 or 4v4) annoys the hell out of me. Also don't forget how the microtransactions are in your face, especially the fact that there are lootboxes and in-game currency obtainable by buying them. You'd think that the progression in a 20 dollar party game would allow you to buy all the cosmetics with only cookies with the option to buy cookies if you really wanna buy a skin immediately but I guess not. I'll re-buy it when they make good changes to the game because I really do wanna see this game thrive.",1.6,0
2023-09-26,"Most complaints are about the lack of an offline mode or micro transactions for cosmetics. If you are like me and don't care about either of those things, then definitely give the game a shot because it's one of the funniest games out there",10.3,1

2023-09-26,"This game is really fun to play, the silly characters and mechanics are very on point. The many different stages and game modes keep you engaged and the 8 player cap makes it just enough mayhem but without getting crazy like fall guys for example (something about that much people and lag makes it less enjoyable for me). You can definitely progress the game and get avatars and cosmetics without spending another dollar, and there's enough of those I think. There IS a lot to buy don't get me wrong, which bothers me a bit because I usually enjoy seeing a lot more rewards for my progress in game but overall I don't think they're abusing players by paywalling all customization, just saying. Would be nice to have more servers in other parts of the world so people don't play in >100ms latency like in South America and Oceania but I read somewhere here that they did blunder a bit and running this thing is rather expensive so I wouldn't hold my breath on that one or buy it expecting that they expand it to other regions soon. 8/10.",32.1,1

2023-09-25,"One of the best games to come out this year. People are mad over offline mode which is very stupid, and definitely not worth a not recommend, people crying about micro transactions, you don't have to buy anything in this game, you can unlock plenty of skins by leveling up, if you don't want to pay micro transactions you dont have to, you can unlock almost everything for free if you work hard enough",18.9,1

No battle pass, but leveling progression system with rewards. The game is also auto-fill and you will most of the time have a full lobby unless someone leaves.",63.5,1

BUT JUST SO YOU KNOW you can just play the game casually and you'll get whatever skins for free and the ones that has Nemo Bucks on them. I got plenty skins already just by playing the game. This is just a fun wacky game that you can enjoy with players in quick matches or your friends online. This game also has CROSSPLAY. I didn't think i would see a Xbox or PSN Player. So if you have a friends from a different platform you can add them and play with them. It is your choice to support the devs or not. So far my experience with this game is really fun.",26.9,1

2023-09-25,"I really wanted to like this game. Aside from the microtransactions and predatory in-game store that everyone else has mentioned, the UI is terrible. You can't see what button is highlighted when you're selecting with a controller, the UI is slow and chunky and it's hard to figure out how to do certain things, like add a second player split screen. But the store is front and center! Also you can play local splitscreen, but you have to be online for it, and you can't play with other players online, you can only play against AI in custom games. Also you don't earn any xp or currency when you're playing in custom games, so if you're playing local splitscreen don't expect to unlock anything. I would have refunded this game but my kid played it enough that I'm past the 2 hours.",45.2,0

2023-09-25,This game is great for laughs and playing with family and friends! I'm really not happy about the prices for some of the characters you can buy in-game. It's almost insulting that I'm being asked $85 USD or more to purchase Ori for example. That's insane! I don't see triple A games asking for that for their baseline. Feels a bit too greedy to me. I hope that this is something as simple as an exchange rate misunderstanding on their part. I can feed a family of two with healthy meals for almost two weeks for $85. I share that to hopefully help put that into perspective.,19.0,1
2023-09-25,"The review bombing is AWFUL and UNNECESARY. This game is EXTREMELY FUN! I had to examine reviews before purchasing but I'm glad I bought the game. It's like Gang Beasts and Fall Guys had a baby. SOME of the game modes are like Fall Guys and some are like Gang Beasts but 90% of the levels are there own thing and make for some involving game play. People expected an ""offline play"" but be patient the game only came out recently and besides this game is MEANT FOR online play anyway. I definitely recommend getting this game as its super fun, involving and interactive. Everyone can decide what map they want and are allowed to vote on it. The only bad thing is leaving a game has a penalty but other people can join in mid-way through a match making it a unnecesary punishment. The game is already getting sponsors and skins! The devs are interacting with the community having already numerous fan-made skins. Don't listen to the negative reviews. Once you buy this game you'll be glad you got it! :)",12.6,1

2023-09-25,"This game is fire. If you like Gang Beasts you should totally get this. Even if you don't like gang beasts or know what Gang Beasts is, you should get this. A lot of people are complaining about microtransactions, but they aren’t that bad. Yes, you can buy currency, but you can also earn it in the free “battle pass” like system. Sometimes items in the shop will cost actual money, but like just don’t buy them. You can get plenty of skins by just playing. And don’t act like you wouldn’t want to make money if it was your game. Input latency doesn’t even exist (for me at least). The only problem is no offline play, but multiplayer is super fun. And I’m sure offline play will be added in the future.

2023-09-25,Many folks who have issues are at odds with with the payment system. Payment is only for cosmetics--it is NOT pay-to-win.

2023-09-25,"Game is very fun, great playing with friends, and has in-game voice chat which is a plus. It's basically a combination of Gang Beasts & Fall Guys together. Only downsides is that it doesn't have an offline co-op mode like originally promised (would be great to play at parties) it's just online-only, not Steam Deck compatible yet, and how some of the micro transactions cost more than the base game. But overall for a $20 game its great. I highly recommend buying and can't wait for what the future of this game has in store.",38.9,1
2023-09-25,"It's a complete blast. There are some minor bugs with controllers and it has microtransactions, but only a very limited amount of skins are behind a paywall. The gameplay is very fun and chaotic and it has enough maps and modes to keep you entertained for a while.",119.5,1
2023-09-25,Tons of fun. The game is extremely polished in all aspects and I have yet to see a bug. There are 20 maps currently so there is quite a bit of variation between matches as well as there being a TON collectibles that you can get through simply playing the game. One of the best multiplayer indie games to release this year for sure!,15.0,1

2023-09-25,"As somebody with about 40 hours played in this game, here are my thoughts. A great game and super fun to play with friends. For those who don't have friends (L), you can join there discord and be a part of a fun, decently nice, community. While it isn't the best game, it is very fun and for at least a good while, not repetitive (In my opinion). I understand that people have their frustrations with the game, I have my fair share of dislikes as well, but it is still an overall fun game! I personally think it is best to start playing with a friend if possible, so you can learn together. I also recommend watching videos by ""@ScoobyYTT"" on YouTube for tips when you are starting, or when you just need some extra help. In conclusion, party animals is a pretty good game. It is very fun with friends, and has a large (mostly) friendly community around it. If you have the $20 dollars to spend, I recommend using it on this game.",42.3,1

Make the items break after like 3 or 4 hits, last thing that i don't like is how you can team kill yeah its funny but it can be really annoying at times if its like duos and they throw you off. But overall i like this game a lot would i recommend it? Yes and No its mixed but if you have the money and wanna try it go ahead its very fun even by yourself!",13.1,1
2023-09-25,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.",6.3,1

Others with insta-death will have you sitting there doing nothing watching others play for 90% of the round. And some maps can go on forever, which can be tiresome if you don't enjoy it. Very few servers currently so the lag can also make an already clumsy game feel even more like a chore. Still, overall, I do think it's a fun game worth playing.

The raw inconsistency of the core game play mechanic, makes this game extremely frustrating. Although this can be annoying, the amount of crazy funny things that can happen are high, and the ""after death"" mechanics are absolutely great. Throwing an item from the dead to knock out a friend is super funny and tossing a bomb into the mix of a small map creates some good moments.",1.4,1

2023-09-25,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The developers have proven very quickly that they do not care about their customers. They simply want to milk as many dollars out of you as possible before you can't take their crap anymore. It's insane that it took them 3 years to turn a promising party game into a chinese water torture sim. I wish I could refund this game.,11.3,0

There's way too many micro-transactions in a game that already costs money for you to own.",27.1,0
2023-09-24,"I have very mixed feelings about this game. First and foremost, the game is fun. It's a classic party game that exuberates energy. On the other hand, there is a very prevalent cash shop that I have a gut feeling the creators will focus on spending the majority of their resources into. This game will die if there is no new content added, the amount of maps currently on hand isn't exactly a bunch. On top of that, I'd say about 40% of the maps feel almost like a slog to complete (looking at you hockey, soccer, football). I want more maps with more chaotic events happening, mix that with creative backdrops and you really can't go wrong. Look at Gangbeasts, that game is perfection with how it handled its maps. They're chaotic and whimsical.",31.8,1

2023-09-24,"(at the time of making this review 9/24) I'm very neutral about this game. its not bad, but I've played better rag-doll fighters, the problem is, some maps when you get knocked out of the ring the climbing is inconstant, you'll sometimes get out on the first try and sometimes you won't. but sometimes when you do, theirs someone waiting for you to knock you back down. Someone has a two handed weapon? don't try to get near them unless other people are. weapons don't break so they can keep spamming them unless its the nun chucks then there's a chance that they'll knock themselves out but it doesn't happen often, and when it does your already dead. So far there is no queue for certain game modes or teams, so you have to get lucky that 1 outta 3 maps are the one you wanna play. most of the half of the modes are 4 teams of 2, so maps feel really cramped at times. if they added an option for 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, or 4v4 then you wouldn't have three other teams to worry about. this game is just at the name says PARTY animals, it's still fun to play, but it really shines when you play with friends where as quick play, it's just yourself unless you get a friend. When you're by yourself you can get a rageful teammate who tries to knock you out when you accidentally knock them out because most people don't communicate with each other, and it's very annoying/ difficult to see who your teammate is because they will have their small name as your team color, it would be nice if they had an outline or showed who your teammate is when selecting the animal so you know what they look like. this game has only been out for less than a week so everything i said will/ might change and so will my opinion about this game, I might like it more, I might like it less. If you are thinking of buying it go ahead but play with friends for the time being. If you don't have any friends then i recommend waiting, making friends, or playing custom games. 6/10 because with friends it's fun.",5.8,1

2023-09-24,"(5/10) Very fun, especially with friends! Ignore the reviews claiming you need to spend twice as much on the game in order to look good, that's a flat out LIE. Yes the game does have micro-transactions...HOWEVER they are very reasonably priced. Assuming you strictly buy the premium currency (which you can earn through gameplay by the way), it basically equates to $1USD per gacha roll. Those are...the CHEAPEST rolls I've seen in existence, so to those complaining about prices...go play Genshin impact where you literally need to sell a kidney for anything in that game. Ignoring that though, you can also get GREAT outfits through achievements. Also another LIE I'm seeing in this review section is that this game has a ""battle pass"". That's also not true. They're simply level up rewards you get for FREE with no premium track or anything.",32.5,1
2023-09-24,"A game shouldn't have an up-front cost and microtransactions and lootboxes and paid DLC. This monetization scheme is unacceptable. Charge me what you think the game is worth. Don't take your pick of toxic, anti-consumer practices like a twisted buffet.",3.8,0

2023-09-24,"Party Animals is an absolute blast of a game that brings laughter, excitement, and a whole lot of joy into your gaming sessions. While I can't confirm its performance on lower-end systems, my experience on standard hardware was smooth and optimised. Playing with friends is where Party Animals truly shines with its online multiplayer options, delivering hours of hilarity. And for those times when you want to go solo, you can still join in on the multiplayer action online, making it just as entertaining. Micro-transactions are cosmetic only, and you can earn in-game currency through gameplay. I hope the developers stay consistent with updates because Party Animals has the potential to be a long-term favourite, offering a lighthearted and laughter-inducing gaming experience that's hard to beat.",51.9,1
2023-09-24,"I don't usually leave reviews, but this is the first game in a while that I have purchased and regretted buying. The art style is beautiful, the visuals and some of the maps are really cool. However, I didn't enjoy playing this game. There are some weapons that are too OP, when you go to pick up someone and toss them off the map, it is not easy to do. This game feels like gang beasts and fall guys had a baby, and unfortunately it is not as fun as either of those games. I was hoping that I would really like this game, but it really says something when you and all your friends in VC all say at the same time- ""Man, this game sucks."" After playing a couple hours of the game, we all returned it. It is a beautiful game, but I can't and won't recommend people play it. It's just not enjoyable.",3.0,0

These are the reasons that I am sticking a do not recommended rating on this game, the gameplay is great the anticonsumer/predatory practices this game uses are not.

They removed maps, removed offline local play (good luck preserving this game when the company's servers shut down and you can't play this anymore) and that's basically it. They added more item shop skins and nothing more to show for it. The few maps that are good are good, but the ones that are bad stick out like a sore thumb, they're an unbalanced, random mess. I would not recommend you play this unless maybe after 6 months they've added enough content. Which by the way, this game looks like it'll be abandoned in 5 months after the hype dies down.",23.3,0

I pre-ordered this knowing the fact it'd be split-screen online, completely mislead, and the micro-transactions/gambling on this is honestly so pricey that is worth 2x the game makes no logical sense at all, all seems very money hungry, in my opinion this game should be ""FREE to play"" with all the micro-transactions they've added on.",2.1,0

I see a *single* upside to the monetization, which is the game will keep getting updates hopefully along with that, because let's be honest if this game didn't have monetization, I do think it's possible the devs might not even have planned to work on the game for that long. Now that out of the way I have 1 big complaint personally, which I SERIOUSLY feel there needs to be different playlists or something. Genuinely I am getting tired of the sports modes, I found them to be the most absolute boring modes right off the bat, but it's made even worse when they tend to be the most voted modes. Like if I'm being honest, I don't see what players like about them, but at the same time sure they're fun to others, that's great, but I seriously don't want to play them.

2023-09-23,This game was just straight up unfun man. The online only stuff was already a problem but also the game feels awful to play. The hits don't register and the character moves all of the place making it almost impossible to hit anyone. I honestly thought the controls would be as smooth as gang beasts but it aint even close.,0.5,0
2023-09-23,"My Daughter was 5 when we originally got the demo. She loved the game. We waited 3 years for it. She forgot all about it, i thought it would be a good idea to surprise her with the game. She was super excited to play. She played it for 15 minutes and said the game is awful. Shes 8 years old. Cant believe they ruined this, it had so much promise. Her exact quote was : why would they say there is offline play and there isnt?"" Nuff said. F this game",0.6,0
2023-09-23,Expected gang beasts inspired game and was very disappointed. The fact a quick match can lead to a match ban is ridiculous. The one hit knockouts and being knocked out for so long makes it impossible to play. Along with having to spend so much money for so little in return its a nightmare.,3.4,0

2023-09-23,I played the Demo way back and was super eager to pick this game up once it finally released. It took a lot longer than anticipated considering how polished the game already felt back then but this was 100% worth the wait! Fantastic party game for my friends and I. Thanks devs!,33.5,1

Everyone complaining about Party Animals not having an offline mode, you have the right to complain about it. The controls on the PC are not great, it took me an hour to get used to the controls I got used to them and started winning matches and when I wasn't use to the controls time went by like really quick during my learning experience. The graphics are good, the weapons being used don't feel overpowered unless said person using the weapon isn't stopped. when I was in every match they were used other players stopped that person after 10 seconds of use. I enjoyed my 3 hours of play so far and I cant wait to see what more they add to this game. But I give this party game a 7.5/8. Out of 10.",16.1,1

Major con is the levelling system and way to unlock skins/cosmetics. The gacha system is fine but you need to earn more rewards quicker to make it ok.

Honestly I don't get the complaints about microtransactions, yes you can spend money on the games for skins, BUT the in game currency (BOTH CURRENCIES) can be earned in game, just by playing the game... When you level up by playing the game (you level up by winning OR losing) you get rewards such as more skins, money and the in game currency milkbones (and not just 10 when something costs 600, I'm talking you get 1500 when something costs 600, so everything is very much free with the purchase of the game, it just takes time). Don't listen to the people who are saying it's blocked by microtransactions, it really isn't, unless you are too lazy to play the game. 10/10 recommend.",18.1,1

For everyone crying about microtransactions as well, the battle pass is free which gives you FREE currency that you'd normally have to buy.

I just do not get it why it has so many negative reviews which are merely irrational, unkind disparagement of the devs. This is their first game, and I can tell how much work and effort has been put into it. Yes this game has microtransactions but the outfits do not affect the actual gameplay and I adore the free ones. You can unlock some from achievements and leveling up, and that's enough for me.

2023-09-22,"I honestly don't understand why people are getting mad just because some cosmetics cost money. Just don't pay for them, besides this game is very fun and I have never laughed so hard at just a simple game. This game is just hilarious and difficult in a good way. If you play from Asia, I can understand why it's unfair that your ping is so high 24/7. I have played Boomerang-Fu and gang beasts and this is the kind of competitiveness that makes you want to try and win but even if you lose you still have a blast! (edit) Also, I don't understand why people are so mad at the fact that they made a small mistake on the game description, at that point its just making a mole hill a mountain.",13.8,1
2023-09-22,"Only downside for me right now are AFK-Players, which can't be kicked and that quick matches can be played with a party of max 4 players, but a lot of maps are 2v2 team based, so ultimately you can't play with your whole party all the time, but have to fight them. Not a big deal, but if I play with a party, I want to play with them not only to enjoy the game togehter but earning xp, too. With the way it is now, only half of my party gets the winning xp on certain maps (if a pair of us wins ofc).",188.9,1

2023-09-22,"After playing the beta for a little as well as the base game. I had a great time overall and i would say it is worth the $30 if you got the money. Most negative reviews are from people in Oceania and Africa since the servers are awful in terms of ping. But if you live in the US or Europe, then this is a good buy. I also see a lot of people with issues on the monetization and although some of the prices are just plain stupid. overall its not a big issue since the the nemo bucks, which is the ingame money that is monetized, is quite easy to gain from just leveling up. I mean i got a legendary cosmetic from this game without spending a cent. The gameplay itself is sooo much fun. The best way i could describe this game would be by calling it a better Gang Beasts. Although the controls are a little annoying, i still have a great time. The first time i player this game i was crying because of all the funny crap that happens. So i would say this game is worth the price, and if you have friends that want to play then this is a great party game.

Players get a game for free in exchange for accepting some predatory money grabbing nonsense. This game isn't free, and shouldn't subject its players to the usual microtransaction garbage.",2.4,1

2023-09-22,"Man this game is pretty hard to review. It's absolutely fun to play. It's pretty much the gang beast we didn't get. Although the offline mode was essential, I don't think it's for the best to prevent people from buying the game with bad reviews. If developers decide to include offline mode, it will probably require a lot of work and MONEY, which they won't get with so many bad reviews. I don't think it will affect us right now either, as long as servers are kept healthy. The thing that worries me is the future of the game. If devs decide to abandon the game and servers shutdown, we will be left with an unplayable game. So yeah, I will come back in the future if devs don't add offline mode.",17.0,1

I asked him for help on how to play and soon after we were playing matches together. Although I wasn't very good at the game, and we didn't win much, we still had a very great time.

Totally understand that english isn't the dev's first language, but thats a pretty big error to make.

2023-09-22,"Super fun game!! People are complaining about the monetization but it is so much better than most games, you can earn all currency types just by playing, and the only thing you need the currency for is if you want cosmetics. The graphics are super cute and there's a ton of variety in the games. Also the report button actually works which is great so you can stop people from naming themselves slurs haha. I've had the game for two days at this point and I have already won a ton of currency and skins just by playing, so if you don't want to spend real money you really don't have to, other than purchasing the game of course, but $20 for a finished game compared to the wave of half done games for $60+ that have been released lately is great. Also I find the surprise eggs fun! I'd rather do that instead of buying from the shop because it's fun, and there's a chance you'll get way more than the coins are worth. If you don't like the surprise eggs then guess what you can not click the button, I know it's mind blowing, but you have free will and you can not spend money if you don't want to spend money. You earn the currency by leveling up too so just be patient and you'll be rewarded.",28.6,1
2023-09-22,"If you're interested in this game, it's absolutely worth the small $20. The gameplay (whole point of getting a game) is good, and that's what matters.

The price of $20 is also really expensive considering that you do not get any in-game content, and it is hard to farm skins. They basically force you to micro-transactions if you want to get any new skins. If this was a free to play I would understand, but being a $20 game it is hard for me to recommend to all people.

The mixed reviews as a result of the offline confusion are disappointing, as this game is otherwise almost perfect.

2023-09-22,"While the game itself is top notch from game play, to sound and environmental design, it suffers from the same thing I heavily critiqued Overwatch 2 over, with extortionate prices of skins as well as Overwatch 1 and other games back in the day for the lootbox system that the gaming industry was plagued with for years. So for personal reasons I can not and will not recommend this game. I recommend finding other means of acquiring this product if you feel like you MUST have it. Don't support things like this. It hurts the gaming industry through and through and it saddens me to see games like this take such a big step backwards after so much push back of these monetisation practices within the last couple of years. If things change for the better, I will also change my recommendation. But for now, avoid it.",13.2,0

2023-09-22,"Overall, I'd highly recommend this game even if you don't have a big group of friends to play with because playing with random people is still a lot of fun, especially with the voice chat. If you're into online multiplayer, this will work for you but if you're looking for a single player offline game you will be disappointed. You are able to play on the same device with someone next to you on split screen though, there's even AI in custom games so I'm not sure what the issue is with the negative reviews.",17.2,1
2023-09-22,"I don’t recommend currently it needs some patches.

Who wants to sit on a couch with 4 controllers plugged in and play split screen these days? It's 2023, not the early '00s on the PS2. Offline mode is irrelevant. Item shop and micro transactions aren't forced upon you, it's just for cute animal skins. Can't afford it? Sorry, no need to down vote because you're poor. Don't slander this game, it's everything I've been waiting for since Gang Beasts died.

2023-09-22,"With that out of the way, Party Animals takes what gang beasts had, removes the jank and inconsistency, alongside painting everything over with an amazing art style and cute animals.

No lag issues with the custom games.",13.2,1

2023-09-22,"The main thing I'm frustrated with on this game is that you can't use the skins with the clothes. Like I want to use my golden Nemo skin with the jet-pack Nemo outfit but I can't do that.

The complaints about microtransactions, however, they are literally cosmetic only, you can earn in game currency to buy a lot of them straight up if you want, or if you want a super special specific one...you spend real money on it. If you do not want to spend real money, wait and see if it will become an in game currency item (if that is a thing, idk) or maybe don't buy it at all if it is that personal to you.",7.7,1

2023-09-21,The game is extremely fun but sometimes (all the time) i rage BECAUSE THERE ARE ISSUES the issues are that u can attack people in spectator mode like that feature needs to be removed ASAP when im climbing as an example someone hits me with a fish then i die. The other issue is other people hitting me with one punch and WHEN I PUNCH THEM 30 TIMES NOTHING but its probably not to the game is probably cuz of me because it lags and then i cant react quickly. But the game it self is so fun and the charachters are good quality but they gotta make more maps they just keep adding new characters we need new maps not characters. I really like the game and why is everyone saying theres no offline co op there is just go to custom and make a lobby then plug two controllers and play on a split screen or u can play on someone elses lobby idk whats the problem?,27.7,1

2023-09-21,"Micro-transactions, by the time I'm writing this, are JUST for skins, skins that have no effect on gameplay what so ever and they are skins that CAN BE BOUGHT with ingame currency earned from leveling up or playing online games. Gaining XP is a bit slower playing solo, but if you're not the obsessive type that NEEDS TO EARN EVERY SKIN IN A WEEK, you'll manage JUST FINE, by just ENJOYING THE GAME. So any outrage based around THAT is being blown out of the water. If this changes? Then I'll have reason to give grievances, but as the game stands right now? They make no effect to the gameplay nor are they invasive in any way. Don't let reviews talking smack about the game, using THAT as the main point of reference for the bad review, sway you from getting it. There's a decent number of maps and different game modes to play, with more coming down the line I'm sure. Some might find the price tag a little steep for the kind of game it looks like, on the outside, but if you get enough friends together, you will have a blast everytime you boot it up. I bought 4 copies MYSELF and gave 3 of them to friends before the game even went live and I do NOT regret it in the slightest.",15.7,1

The submarine is still random to get up when you're under the sea (of course my stamina is full and somehow the flow makes it annoyingly slippery). The rest is fine and enjoyable. I got np with the offline host or the monetization or latency. So let's hope the devs keep making it better and fix all the bugs in the future like what the NMS devs did.

2023-09-21,I normally don't post reviews but I never had so much fun playing a multiplayer game in such a long time. Party Animals is like a perfect mix of Gang Beast and Mario Kart mini games. I recommend ignoring all the reviews that are complaining about offline mode and micro-transactions. The true fun of the game is playing with people online and the game is very generous with rewarding the player after every level up.,23.7,1

2023-09-21,"I am for sure still gonna clock in a stupid amount of hours into this game laughing my ass off with friends. When it comes to local play, once you get around the inconvenient local setup and garbage split screen UI and whatnot, it still works perfectly fine as a couch multiplayer game. And despite the façade the game wore up until launch, it has still been very much worth the wait, but for those questioning the purchase I simply cannot recommend supporting it until the devs get their ♥♥♥♥ together, listen to the community, add offline play, and dumb it down with the live service microtransaction ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Boycott any in-game purchases, leave negative reviews, and keep reinforcing the obvious problems, all until we get an acceptable response, or more realistically, until the already doomed from the start live service outlook puts this game in the grave within the next 2 years.",36.4,0

2023-09-21,"And I don't want the copy/paste excuse that they started putting in all the reviews about how they got confused and don't know English anymore. Look, many people waited for 3 years for the game to come out, expecting what was already there and much more, tolerating all the silence and excuses. Be honest and say that you're doing it to protect the game. Stop telling lies because you're going to continue like this for the entire life of the game. In these cases, it's better to speak from an honest perspective, as indie developers often do. Besides, if you're using this excuse, it's because you don't plan to release the offline mode, and do you really think, with the peak of players at launch and the excessive amount of sales you'll probably have, that this is necessary?",55.3,0
2023-09-21,bruh. SO MANY negative reviews for some single player offline controversy. WHO CARES. THIS IS THE FUNNEST GAME IVE PLAYED IN YEARS. they absolutely nailed the gang beast vibe but made it fun and cute. please grab it and play with friends.,27.8,1

2023-09-21,"Amazing game with lots of different unique maps, weapons and skins. Has a fun gameplay loop which never really gets old and is lots of fun. This whole complaining about the game not being offline is crazy why would a multiplayer game ever be offline? It's 2023 every multiplayer game now is online. I highly recommend this game. It's hours and hours of fun",23.3,1
2023-09-21,I just started playing the game and I would say it is way better than gang beasts. It has very cute AI and very fun game modes. I haven’t had any problems with controls on both controller and keyboard. My friends and boyfriend love the game a lot. For those complaining about offline mode don’t listen to them. The idea of offline multiplayer mode makes absolutely no sense for a game like this. Also you can easily unlock a bunch of animals and cosmetics the more you play. Highly recommend this game it’s very fun. Also not very much lag issues.,4.2,1
2023-09-21,"This game is really fun! Pretty much exactly what I remember from when I playtested in 2020 or however long ago it was. TLDR if you want a game you can play with friends, go for it! it's a load of fun and laughs. Can buy skins and stuff if you want (I don't personally care for this) and if you wanted to you could play with randoms, but that's not why I bought the game tbh, it has no real value to me. I bought it to play in private lobbies with my IRLs and other friends, and it fits the bill perfectly for that. Kind of like Among Us or Goose Goose Duck in some ways.",9.4,1
2023-09-21,"While I recommend this fun little game, it remains a little game that lacks many options and features. Many players will definitely become bored, very quickly, and returning now and then out of a whim or when there's new content. Throughout the developer's very long and many years of development, not much has changed since the announcement, gameplay previews, and trials. There are not enough animals and customisation options are limited; additional options are locked behind an undesirable paywall, and some through progress. The map range is very limited in quick match which is the main feature. Most maps are fixed to the genre of squad battles; 2v2v2v2 while few are team based; 5v5, the latter appears more desirable during 200 hours of matchmaking (alone and play with friends in their places).",22.6,0

2023-09-21,"I'm so disappointed by Party Animals. I had hoped to be able to play local couch co-op last night but the implementation of this feature is an absolute afterthought at best. I had controllers all controlling player one, with no real understanding as to why - not had this problem in other couch games, so why this? Probably because Recreate Games' goal was to focus on a single player per game, matchmaking online model. I didn't buy this game expecting a live service model, and the always online aspect has put me off completely. This game sorely needs an offline only couch co-op mode, skipping the necessity for logging in to a server. Why? Because once this game for whatever reason dies and the servers pulled, it's completely useless like any other live service game. I sincerely hope the developers listen to their community and the criticism they've faced and make plans to rectify it. Until then this is categorically not a party game.",1.4,0

Not only that but you people have internet i don't see what the deal is specially since you used internet to leave a bad review.",42.7,1
2023-09-21,"The only complaint I have is that there's no tie system. In games like Gang Beasts, if two people die at nearly the same time, the round is a draw.

The only issues I have with this game are small things like it being unclear why you died (e.g. the gas map and the water map) and split-second difference in death times giving one team the win instead of just being a draw, a feature which they actually ended up adding to Gang Beasts. But these are easy fixes (although with how long the devs took to get this game out it might be a while before they get fixed). I get why people are unhappy that the game took this long to come out and then the devs pulled some sneaky ♥♥♥♥, but this game is way too good to have a 55% review score (at the time of this review).

Good customisation, rewarding achievement system, easy to pick up controls, very satisfying knock-out and combat system, many maps and game styles, proximity and full voice chat, etc. Plus you can even still interact with the ongoing match after you've been knocked out. When you add that with quick matchmaking and rounds, you feel like you're always in the game. Would highly recommend if you are looking for a fun game to play with friends online. 5/5 for me.",57.7,1

2023-09-21,Gameplay is great and the new modes are fun. Skins are great and seems to be a decent amount of progression (Level 1-100) with skins and currency in between. Some skins are heavily priced at $20+ while others are pretty cheap or can be bought with cookies that are earned from playing. If you plan on playing online and rarely buying skins there really is no downsides to the game. If you played the tests 3 years ago you also get an exclusive pigeon skin which is hilarious looking.,69.7,1
2023-09-21,"Really fun with friends. Not a huge fan of the in-game currency stuff/loot boxes but it is *only* for cosmetics, and there's a battlepass system that you can play to get that currency (and no, it's not split where you have to pay for all of it, you just play to unlock everything) as well as you can select a skin you'd like to get from the loot boxes and you'll eventually be guaranteed to get it (the one I selected was guaranteed after 2 pulls, if that helps).

2023-09-21,"I have previously made a negative vote on party animals, the result is still the same, I still would give it a negative review, but, the reasoning has changed a lot. Before my biggest complains were as such: 1, no oceanic servers, 2: no solo mode, only team modes, and dependence on teammates, 3: Micro transactions. Now, after around 2 months of new patches, updates, etc, I will now say the game is in a better place than it was, but still suffering in many different categories. They have now added oceanic servers, allowing austrailians to finally play the game without being at such a massive disadvantage you may as well not even play, but, there is still expensive micro transactions, and there is still no solo mode. Again, only team modes makes it so if your teammate or teammate's are bad, or inexperianced, or AFK, etc, you will have a big disadvantage that is detrimental to the point of winning because you were the better player; it is sometimes similar to rolling dice, hoping for a good roll, hence, good teammates that will actually be good, and not throw the game. I would really like to see a solo mode, and honestly, once they do release a solo mode, I will likely come back to this review again, to change it to a probable positive review. Like I said before, the game has improved with many patches, and updates, giving new mechanics, a new map, more skins, challanges, more regions, etc, but, there is still the big problem of micro transactions and only team mode games. Micro transactions are typically seen in primarily free to play games, such as fortnite, and COD warzone, and various other free to play games. But, party animals is normally around 20$ US dollars, for the standard edition. But, the dev's still decided they needed many ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ microtransactions that are just as much money, to buy the game, as to get 2 lame, boring legendary skins. Once both these problems are fixed, or made easier to withstand, I will still be giving this game a negative review.",80.4,0

Personally it has no impact on the way I plan to play the game. It is absolute chaos in the best way, sometimes the climbing can get a little weird but that's the only issue I've seen so far. No issues having people join my game or issues joining lobby's. Season pass is free and gives a lot of free currency and paid for currency, gives lots of skins, emotes, and avatars. It has micro transactions for outfits which I don't understand why anyone would be pissed about that...just don't spend your money on it if you don't want it lol. 10/10 will be playing this with my wife, brothers, and solo for a long time to come I can already tell.",16.8,1

2023-09-21,"There is indeed a non-official offline mode. create a custom match and just add controllers for local and AI to beat on. remote play also works just fine. I understand the terminology issues but truthfully not having an actual local mode doesn't at all keep you from enjoying this game on or offline with friends, people are truly just being internet police about OFFLINE MODE . the fact that you can do local and also invite friends in the same lobby is a definite plus in my book . it not point in a local mode if you can split screen in custom....THATS LOCAL",42.4,1
2023-09-21,"I absolutely loved this game when it seemed feature complete back in 2020. I thought it'd be even better with 3 years of polish, but they didn't do anything, aside from go back on their world of local coop offline, and only seemed to have added mtx in a game you already pay for.

They lied to sell a freemium game for full price. I am disheartened and disappointed. What a bunch of greedy jerks.",0.2,0
2023-09-21,"Do not pay attention to the ""mixed"" review since the game mainly got review bombed by a bunch of tantrum-throwers. This game is FANTASTIC, very fun to play with friends. My biggest problem with it is that there are skins in the game that cost $22USD but you really don't NEED any of the skins. If someone wants to spend that much go ahead and if you don't want to spend that much on a skin then... just don't? There are plenty of adorable skins in the game that you can get without spending any money (other than buying the game).",5.1,1

I was laughing so hard I was crying constantly. I couldn't even see through the tears. The item shop is reasonable and they even give you opportunities to get bucks in the game by leveling and beating maps through quick match. It deserves love and support, not hate. I highly recommend this game. I also highly recommend playing quick match. It's been hilarious playing with other people and listening to them in open mic.",19.8,1

2023-09-21,"Amazing game. My only (small) critic is the controls change. For those who played the beta in 2020 like me, I feel like the controls slightly changed for something more user friendly. You used to be able to move each arm freely, and had to control both arms to climb up (kinda like Human Fall Flat). Now you just hold 2 buttons and the game does the rest for you. It felt weird for me at the beginning but you get used to it quickly. 20 maps with different game modes makes this game a great purchase.",83.1,1
2023-09-21,It's fun for what it is. I wasn't really expecting an offline mode for this game so I had nothing to be outraged by.

I am completely aware it only happens when a team of 3 matches with another team of 3 or 4 and solos to fill in any empty spots. After this update it feels like I get a 4v4 game every 4 out of 5 games I play. And I hate it. Either make a solos playlist further dividing the multiplayer playlist, or try something else out. I already removed my previous negative review because I slowly started to like the game. This is not it.",107.6,0

With its delightful and whimsical characters, ingenious gameplay mechanics, and a seamless blend of chaos and camaraderie, ""Party Animals"" stands as a shining example of what gaming can and should be.

2023-09-21,"Phenomenal game that's even better with friends. You can make a private lobby as well and still level up (at a slower rate than online) while doing so if you don't want to play against randoms. Some things need tweaking like being able to one hit KO someone right off the bat with a dropkick or a sprint punch, the ranged weapons feeling too inaccurate, and when in water or the air, you are absolutely helpless to get back to a platform. Other than that, everything is great. Micro-transactions are optional for skins, but you can earn both forms of in-game currency to eventually unlock what you want. The hatred over no offline play is absurd. if you want to play with just yourself and your friends at your house, just make the aforementioned private lobby and lock it so only people with a code can join. Also, the devs don't owe you a solo experience. It's a party game, if you don't like it because you can't play solo, your missing the whole point of ""party"" in ""party game"".",28.2,1

I understand a lot of people are upset about the promise of offline play that got taken out post release and I definitely get that, but otherwise this is genuinely such a good game. I've gotten a bunch of free eggs and both kinds of in game currencies to spend in the shop already, so I don't understand what the issue with micro transactions a lot of people are talking about is stemming from. I'm having a great time playing for free and don't feel the need to make any kind of purchase. 10/10 really enjoying it",19.3,1

2023-09-21,The people that are really complaining about this game are the same people who buy COD skins..... This game is SO MUCH FUN. Best party game ever. also you do not need to pay for anything other the the game itself of course. the offline complaint is just dumb its a live service game with leveling so it has to be connected. Don't let these people tell you its a scam it is a great time with friends.,44.8,1
2023-09-21,"If you're seeing this, ignore the mixed reviews and just buy it. I really don't understand why people are hating on this game so much just because they had a miscommunication thing and no offline mode. If you don't have internet, play with bots until you get internet. Now I understand the hate about the loot boxes, but even then, you can get money from the free battle pass. The money doesn't even cost that much to purchase anyway compared to other triple a games, and at least the game isn't pay to win. Also, recreate is a BRAND NEW COMPANY. This is their first game, so they probably need some money to keep making good content. Just give recreate a break.",10.9,1

2023-09-21,"Some people making negative reviews have NO IDEA WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT. Let me clear some things up. Point 1) Yes the game does have a cash shop that is STRICTLY for cosmetics and nothing that actually gives you an advantage. NOTHING is forcing you to spend money on this part of the game. Point 2) You can earn premium currency by playing the game unlike what others are saying. You get certain amounts for certain level up milestones. Point 3) The no offline issue. I understand why people are upset about this and the description of the offline play was a bit misleading, but if I am correct you can still do couch co-op with your friends with on the same device through split screen. Honestly the hate this game is getting is kind of sad, to the point people are trying to find things to complain about, to the point of complaining about there being TOO MANY game modes. All in all, this is a fantastic game to play with friends or randoms in quick match and for a great price.",7.3,1

2023-09-21,Now this is my only complaint so far I played with my Boyfriend back in 2020 which is what made us interested in the game in the first place and he received 10 gotcha coins and a skin because of playing the beta in 2020 yet i didn't receive anything and I'm pretty pissed off about it cause it seems from the discord and their website its not just me but multiple people and I'm not sure if they have any intention on fixing it as they have only came up with the excuse of we don't give out those rewards steam does which seems to me like they can make a complaint and force them to give out these earned rewards I have been loyal and so excited to play but this does not make me encouraged to support the game if there is no reward then excuses.,9.8,1

2023-09-21,"I've been watching this game for YEARS as I always saw it as ""Gang Beasts with weapons"". Yes, it is extremely unfortunate about the miscommunication (or lying, whatever you desire) and I can understand why people are hating on it so hard. However, I had the intention of playing this game with friends through the party system in-game or through the Steam Remote Play. For my intentions, this game is GREAT! It was exactly what I was hoping for when I first heard about the game. However, there is a ♥♥♥♥ ton of micro-transactions, which is not my forte. Luckily they are just skins and not pay-to-win (for the time being). If you have access to internet and want to play this game with friends, then I'd recommend it. The negative reviews aren't about the gameplay, they're about the last minute switch up. Hopefully they eventually change this, or at least refund the people who pre-ordered assuming it was something else. But for what I intended it to be, I got exactly what I wanted.",3.8,1

Microtransactions are not constantly in your face and, believe or not, no one is making you buy nemo bucks. Game is great and I can't wait to see what additions come!! Excellent work Recreate :)",50.7,1
2023-09-21,"Great fun! If you liked Gang Beasts even just a little, then you'll love this, it's basically an improvement in every way. Local multiplayer is not present for now but that's the only drawback. There is a cash shop, but you get tons of stuff just by playing so the cash shop isn't even a big deal, and it's not heavily shoved in your face like in some games. Solid connection online with basically zero lag, playing with friends from the other corner of the country. Tons of items, maps, and game modes. The game also lets you add AI if you want to try the team games but have an odd number. If you get killed in the brawl mode, you're not just sitting and waiting like in Gang Beasts, you get to actively mess with the players still alive. It's great fun and after only a few hours my friends and I were starting to get hoarse from all the laughing.",7.9,1

However, I'm glad I did and the game deserves a lot of credit. It does almost everything right. I was able to play local co-op with my daughter with no issues. The gameplay is smooth, fun, sound and graphics are quite good and so far I've been very impressed with map variety. AI is at least as good as Gang Beasts. I'm glad I decided to buy, and for me the lack of offline play and the microtransactions are non issues and it does not effect my experience. I don't plan on paying for microtransactions (unless they release a frog, then I might drop some cash). I've only played custom games with local co-op and have had no issues with lag. As a fan of Gang Beasts, Boomerang-fu, Stick Fight the Game, Rounds, A Gummy Life - I can recommend this game.",17.9,1

You only get cookies from leveling up (Sometimes), achievements/weekly challenges, or converting payed currency into cookies. Just give me cookies for playing games.

2023-09-21,I'm going to stick to reviewing the ACTUAL game here. It's extremely fun and goofy. There's a certain charm to the wobbly physics and cute nature of seeing stuffed animals beating each other up. Something to play with friends sort like Super Smash Bros. Been waiting a long time for this game and I'm happy it's finally here. Enjoying it very much and would recommend. The whole time I'm just laughing and smiling. I don't even care about losing a match. It's too silly to get upset at. 8.5/10 - Looks like you can earn a bunch of the paid currency through the progress line. I already have 440 and I barely played which is nice to see not all the skins are strictly behind a paywall.,22.4,1

My need for purchasing supplements like creatine and tren have become completely obsolete. Walking around with a third leg has become more of a burden than a blessing. Washing it has been a struggling because of how massive and girthy it is now (a common side effect of playing Party Animals).

2023-09-21,"Very good game, a bit frustrating at the ""beninging"" but once you get the hang of it it starts being fun, the most important thing its to NOT GET COMPETITIVE...just have fun...don't mind all the negative comments about the skins and ""offline mode"".....like bro...who the HELL doesn't have internet wherever you go......if you dont have one...why even buy the game anyway...split-screen is still available, yea they misocomunicated and said it has offline mode....big sad EVERYONE MAKES MISTAKES AND EVERYONE HAS INTERNET CONNECTIVITY BRO...it's a game in 2023...ofcorse skins are gonna cost 30$....but you have a ton of skins that you can get for free and you get a ton of in-game currency to buy them when there is a weekly or daily re-roll, been playing this for over 20 hours (playtest included), and having a ton of fun!!",14.9,1

2023-09-21,"The game is fun and well-optimized, runs well on a Steam deck, and 20 and 40 series of RTX cards, making it an overall good experience. Demand for offline local op is a valid request, but not a negative review worthy of it. The game has one quick play mode, which allows you to play online with other players; there are 20 maps divided into a few modes; and a second custom mode, which gives you the ability to play any map with friends online. There are no major game-breaking bugs. As for micro-transactions, the game has micro-transactions, but they are purely cosmetic and provide no advantage. The game has three different currencies: cookies, Nemo bucks, and coins. Cookies are the free currency that you earn by playing the game and leveling up, which can be used to buy skins in the shop. Nemo Bucks are the premium currency that you buy with real money to buy skins. Nemo bucks can also be used to convert to cookies or gold coins. Gold coins have so far been used in the Gacha loot box to get skins at random. You can also earn premium currency, Nemo bucks and coins, which you stop earning after reaching level 100 as of writing this review.",12.0,1

2023-09-21,Overall dont take the Offline only and MTX haters as proof if you played Gang Beasts and have a friend who has any of the supported platforms and a decent internet connection at least for now until the devs add a offline mode which could happen given live service guarantees long term support for the game if its done right. If we preach are wants on it loud enough I am sure it can come to fruition after all other live service games have done it so in any case yha its a 8/10 its a amazing party game if you can get past the fact its a live service with the baggage that entails.,2.5,1

2023-09-21,"I wrote a good review one day that said this was a good game but now after playing it with friends and alone i would tell you to not waste your money on this game, the community for some reason has become super toxic and now games seem like a competition in Esports vs just a screw around game. There are no game modes to choose from if you're solo good luck having fun in this game there is no FFA and you always seem to run into the one guy that is color blind and just keeps knocking you out defeating the purpose of teams. weapons killing you is one of the stupidest thing i can imagine you would want to keep in the game you just get people who pick up the shovel and swing on you until you either get knocked off or die and while talking about weapons they are highly unbalanced unless you're a pro at this game the only way to take out a weapon user is to drop kick them BUT good luck drop kicking anyone on the airplane map and the sub map or you re just gonna fly off and as for maps the maps are EXTREMELY random if you knock someone off at the beginning of the round and throw them off you just wasted your time because there is no way they will die to poison water or ice in the first 3 minutes so really you should just run around and wait until you can pick up a weapon and spam anyone to win and final point the climbing is so stupid on one map you can climb like a goat and the next you can barely hold on and jump up TL:DR just another game that's extremely unbalanced and devs that will just assume they know how to balance the game by doing nothing right so save that 20$ for another game that wont piss you off",35.1,0

Not sure why people get so upset over losing a game like this but alright. Playing in singleplayer is nice since the AI in this game is actually quite competent. Hopefully they'll boost singleplayer XP gain to make this a truly 10/10 experience.",38.8,1

2023-09-21,Waited a while for this and had a few lol moments already. Sometimes team mates hinder you but on the whole thumbs up. How often do you play a game offline anyway and don't buy cosmetics if you don't want to. They give you zero advantage anyway.,27.6,1

And even so why do people complain about long queues when they're playing an unpopular game that got released 10 hours ago, what do you expect? That instantly everyone from your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ country that has 250 people are going to buy this game? AND THERE ARE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ LOBBIES HOSTED BY PEOPLE? THAT YOU CAN JOIN WHENEVER YOU WANT? HOW INCREDIBLY STUPID DO YOU HAVE TO BE TO NOT SEE THAT WITH YOUR EYEBALLS? And why are people complaining about offline again? I mean you don't really have the money to get the most important thing there is in the world right now, internet? That just proves my point more that you live in the Russian Siberias permafrost where there is more poverty than particles of snow, where there are more homeless people than houses? Grow the ♥♥♥♥ up and even try to enjoy something will you? It's so childish to see people complaining for no actual reason, did they really decide to write a review telling people not to buy this game because it doesn't have the offline abilities they want. I mean this game wasn't made by rockstar or epic games or any other HUGE gameseller this is a little company that made a good game with suprising graphics and the game is actually really fun, but these ♥♥♥♥♥ get the smart idea to review the game as ""bad"" because it wasn't made by the worlds best game developers. ♥♥♥♥ you",6.0,1

2023-09-21,"decided to edit this review to anyone feeling sceptical due to the other reviews, i solely play with my friends so i don't know what to say about people complaints about not being able to play offline + the developers made a statement addressing it which boils down to mistranslation/miscommunication due to not being native English speakers. A lot of the reviews/comments harp on the fact that the game now has microstransactions/lootboxes, while this is true they are only cosmetics and even so you can earn the currency used for them simply by playing the game or if you're impatient you can buy the currency personally, if you can play to earn and only have cosmetics, i have no gripe against adding lootboxes, i literally got my now favourite skin (golden sparky) just by getting an achievement.

If you are in the OCE region do not buy this game the devs do no care about you and you won't have a fun experience.

Offline mode i can understand but the store can be avoided and the servers are fine now. The actual gameplay of this game is brilliant, haven't laughed so hard in a while playing a game and I plan to play this for a very long time. I believe this game should at least have mostly positive reviews because it absolutely nails what a party game should be, a fun time with friends with maximum laughs.",39.1,1

I personally don't mind it, as far as skins go it is SUPER easy to get skins for free. Along with over 75% of the Skins being Earnable. you can get over 6000 Nemo bucks for free just by playing the game. Good amount of content you can earn.
