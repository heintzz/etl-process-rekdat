Whats even dumber is they've added a new mechanics for 'Losers' to peg stuff at other players as a way to be an annoying sore loser.

Posted: November 15,"TLDR: Fun with friends, frustrating mechanics, bad game company. Is the game fun with friends? Sure. But this game is enraging. I didn't have any expectations coming into the game so unlike most the reviews, I don't care about the loot boxes that much or lack of offline mode but it seems like big corporation screwed over loyal backers. My problem with this game lies with some of the mechanics. The maps without a insta-kill zone are extremely inconsistent. For example the gas map I will watch some people spend 5 to 10 seconds slowly getting back to the platform and survive. This precedes to happen 4 times and the person still survives. Meanwhile I had a match where about 3 seconds into the match I was thrown in the gas and preceded to die seemingly instantly. Along with this, the hit registration is inconsistent as well. I will watch my powered up punches slam into someones face 4 times with no knockout, then get one hit by something that didn't even look like it hit me. Also the power punch is only thrown from the right hand which is a small detail that I think should change as there are many times I wish he would just throw the left hand instead. Most people would boil this down to skill issue which is fine, its my review, and I prefer my games to have a sense of control and consistency which this game completely lacks. If you don't care about that than yeah the game is great fun. My last grievance is that once you reach lvl 100, I don't see a way to gain nemo bucks which means your only option is to buy their premium currency to buy loot boxes to hope to get the skin you want. For a 20 dollar game, this business practice is pathetic. The amount of nemo bucks you earn from leveling up and achievements just isnt enough to get the skins you want and they know that. They just want you to spend more money to gamble and hopefully find the skin you want.",24.2 hrs on record,Not Recommended

Posted: November 4,"For the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease 2 8-inch round cake pans. Line with parchment paper, then butter/spray with cooking a medium size bowl combine the flour, sugar, unsweetened cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Set the bowl of a stand mixer (or use a hand held mixer) beat together the eggs, buttermilk, greek yogurt, canola oil and vanilla until smooth.Slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients with the mixer on low until there are no longer any clumps of flour. Add the hot coffee and mix until combined. Batter should be pourable, but not super thin. Stir in the chocolate chips, if using.Pour the batter among the 2 cake pans and bake 20 to 25 minutes, until the tops are just set and no longer wiggly in the center. Remove and let cool five minutes, then run a knife around the edges of the pan. Grab 2 large flat plates, line them with wax or parchment paper and invert the cakes onto the paper lined plates. Cover and let the cakes cool completely before frosting.For the Frosting: Add the butter and powdered sugar to the bowl of a stand mixer (or use a hand held mixer). Beat the butter and powdered sugar together until the butter is light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add the cocoa powder and vanilla and beat, scrapping down the sides as needed another 2 minutes or until there are no streaks of white. Add 3 tablespoons of the heavy cream and whip the frosting for 2-4 minutes or until light and fluffy. If desired add the remaining tablespoon of the heavy cream (I normally do) and whip until combined. Taste the frosting and add more powdered sugar if you like a sweeter or thicker frosting.Place 1 layer, flat side up, on a plate or cake stand. With a knife or offset spatula, spread the top with frosting. Place the second layer on top, rounded side up, and spread the frosting evenly on the top and sides of the cake. Decorate with sprinkles, chocolate curls or whatever your heart desires. *To quickly bring eggs to room temperature place them in a bowl and fill with warm water. Let them sit five minutes.",8.8 hrs on record,Recommended

This inconsistency spreads elsewhere, one second I'm tossing someone in the ice and they swim for a good 3 seconds, climb up, get knocked down in the water and are able to climb out once more, then if I get pushed off within those 3 seconds I'm froze, there are many examples of this and it makes the game very unfun when at its core it's a pretty enjoyable party game with some really fun games, but it's just too much, maybe in future updates......but I have a weird feeling that this is something that'll remain very much the same game with no major QoL changes or updates made but I'd like to be wrong and I'd like to change my review if those things happen along with it.",54.5 hrs on record,Not Recommended

Posted: October 28,"At first I was hesitant spending $20 on a game from a new Dev team and also seeing the negative reviews. Do NOT listen to the negative reviews. This is gang beast on steroids. No pay for skins bs (like alot of games nowadays), you unlock skins, bones and dollars so fast it actually gives you the ability to use the item shop without having to spend irl money. Playing online is really great, haven't faced any connection issues. The game mechanics are great, not perfect, but still really good. 2 minute timeout makes sense. You leave a game YOU started, you are gonna get a timeout. If you can't wait 2 mins you need to learn how to have patience. Solid game worth the $20. Split screen is a little wonky, I won't lie but this is the early 2000's with LAN parties anymore. I get the complaint but it still works. Solid game all around 8.3/10",25.9 hrs on record,Recommended

Plenty of achievement based rewards and weekly/daily challenges to complete for XP and in-game currency. The mechanics of the game are fun as well, with a good variety of mini games/game modes in rotation.

Unfortunately, it seems like the devs really just do not care about the community's interests. Local Play is a mediocre experience with huge frame drops when using split screen (split screen already being a HUGE disappointment), the obvious predatory features like loot boxes/gacha/insane in-game currency prices in general, and there's no visible road-map provided on any of the game's social media pages; there really hasn't been any notable updates, besides minor bug fixes, within the month that it has been out.

My son got this game for his birthday from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

Posted: October 17,"This game is lots of fun with friends. Reviews had me worried about the monetization model, but the in-game currency is super easy to obtain. I already have a collection of cute skins from leveling up and completing achievements. There's plenty of toxicity in voice chat, but that's pretty easy to disable (not sure why open mic is on by default?) Also, I hope the people who want an offline mode eventually get that, but, for me personally, I don't have much of a need for it. If that's a concern of yours, maybe hold off of buying. Overall, I think the game's worth it if you enjoy online party games and general low-stakes fun. Party Animals is one of the few games that's made me actually laugh out loud in recent memory :)",30.4 hrs on record,Recommended

Posted: October 15,This game is just pure hilarious fun. If you were a fan of the game Gang Beasts then you will love this game. cannot praise this game enough. my only gripe is that it does not run very well on the steam deck when a game as small as this should run pretty well in my opinion. hopefully future updates might address that.,12.1 hrs on record,Recommended

Posted: October 14,Very fun game with fun fighting with cute animals. I hope to see more maps and more furry friends to come along. This game does not deserve mixed reviews it is a good game. Many people don’t like it because you have to have internet to play and cannot play without. I do not think this is a problem at all since all you have to do is just make a private lobby and you can play with family and friends and almost everybody has internet. Also people say that their are micro transactions but this is not true at all because all of the currency can be earned totally free with the free battle-pass-like reward system. Another problem people don’t like about it is that when their are two players it is split screen. My honest review is that people shouldn’t have such high expectations for game that just barely released and shouldn’t be rating this game a bad review because this game is still in an early stage. The devs have been updating this game very often and if they keep doing so this game won’t come to a sad ending.,37.3 hrs on record,Recommended

Posted: October 9,This game is great. Microtransactions are just cosmetic. If it keeps the developers making new content then I'm all for it. I don't get why people ♥♥♥♥♥ about microtransactions if it isn't pay to win. I'd rather it be a 19.99 game with microtransactions for cosmetics than a 59.99 game with all skins. I been playing for only 9 hours and never spent a single penny and already unlocked a lot of uncommon/rare skins just by leveling up and using the in game currency awarded to me for free. Only downside is its not a couch coop game and and its online only. If you have discord friends to play with then its a no-brainer to buy this game. If you're only looking for an offline-experience then I'd wait till that becomes a thing. Feel free to add me if you'd like to join me and friends play :D,14.4 hrs on record,Recommended
Posted: October 9,"So in all reality I can only say, the game is not worth the 18$ price tag, it isnt even worth a 5$ price tag in its current state. If they want to insist on a premium currency in the store that they force FOMO on and include lootboxes they should make the game f2p. if they want to keep the price tag put all skins in a shop for premium currency and have the rotation one solely use the cookies to buy skins from and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ gacha should NOT be premium and instead be cookies again.",65.7 hrs on record,Not Recommended

Posted: October 8,"It blows that you need to be connected to the internet to play the game. I usually have like 10-20 ping in most games, but in this one its 70 (in cali) and constantly spiking, even if you manage to convince some friends to get the game, you will without a doubt be faced with an internet connection error from the server within 10 minutes. Not even to mention no offline local play, I typically play these couch games with my siblings and we still suffer from it despite having fiber internet and amazing connection with every other game. So I cant play with my buds online, or my bros offline, just a bad call from the devs. Also no I will not pay for cosmetics on a 20 dollar party game.

Posted: October 7,"After just buying a new PC with what I'd consider to be pretty good specs (NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050, AMD Ryzen 5 5600 6-Core Processor and 16GB of RAM), I fully expected this game to run at no less than 60 FPS, which wasn't the case at all. After around 30 minutes of consistent gameplay, the FPS dropped so slow (around a 5-10 FPS mark) to the extent that it became unplayable. Another few noteworthy inconsistencies would be the gameplay mechanics altogether, i.e punching, grabbing, throwing. Everything just seems so tedious and luck based to the point where it doesn't feel rewarding at all when you win games, it's almost as if the only way to successfully execute an intended action is to pray to the luck gods that your character decides to align properly to the exact correct molecule. It's like controlling a boneless corpse. Not to mention the weapon spawns too. Why is it fair that one player with a shovel or nun-chucks can knock other players out in seconds? That way the game just becomes a race to get a weapon and practically become unstoppable. I recall being able to keep a player knocked out on the ground almost permanently by just spamming the headbutt control, rendering them useless for the majority of the match. One unintended press of a button and it could be the reason for a loss. Keeping in mind the target audience for this game is likely younger children, I can imagine that it's perhaps unfair to judge a family type party game on control consistency, but it's no secret that older audiences play this game too. Not to mention that this game costs actual MONEY with very minimal maps and game modes to play on as well as an army's worth of in-game purchases that can be made for a pretty excessive price in my opinion. This game is in NO way worth it's price, nor is it worth playing alone (or on a decent PC for some reason?). There is an extensive amount of teamwork based modes in this game too, which I found to be unpleasant when being paired with literal children that had absolutely no idea what they were doing, making winning almost impossible when almost every single match I participated in, I HAD to have a teammate. Overall, if you're looking for a funny party game where you beat people up, buy Gang Beasts.",5.2 hrs on record,Not Recommended

I will say there some sweaty people who play this, but if you can beat them, the extra challenge and higher level of game play mixed with the random physics is fun.

There's balancing issues with weapons, and i dislike that the rng factor is strong when it comes to either winning or losing. It feels bad to lose a game because the game decides you're gonna die. The game also needs more mini games and maps. Out of all the games, I probably only like half of them because the other half are either not fun or can be cheesed by others and the good old rng. Sadly the bad outweighs the good so i cannot recommend in this state.",14.0 hrs on record,Not Recommended

Posted: October 2,"Party Animals isnt just a game, its a saviour of my life. This beautiful physics-based game is a masterpiece of its kind, this was the inevitable grand upgrade from gang beasts. I didnt know how badly i needed such a game to come into my life. You see, I suffer from a lot of illnesses, you name it - i got it. Anyway, this game became a runaway escape to a vast new reality, away from all my illnesses. I didnt have the stress of doctors running in and out of my hospital room, giving me organ and blood transplants, no... this game was a whole new dimension for me. It wasnt just a game anymore, it was the reason I was saved. I played and played party animals and slowly the doctors noticed I got better. Not long after, I had mildly healed from most of my illnesses, and soon after, I didnt have them anymore. I slowly looked to my screen with the lobby screen of Party Animals, a tear shed from my eye. I impulsively hugged the screen as tears ran down my face, ""Party Animals"" I cried, ""Thank you so much..."". Party Animals had saved my life. I was free.

Yes, some skins are locked behind a currency, but i have been able to acquire any skin i liked, without paying, but by playing. grind enough games, and you can get your skins. Dont listen to people crying about it. they just dont want to put the effort, but rather put the effort of spreading negativty. F*** humans, love animals <3",82.5 hrs on record,Recommended

Posted: October 1,"It's a fun game to play with friends and even make new ones, but the climbing needs work, the attacking could be a bit better, the weapons need to be brought down in power (mainly the nun-chucks) a lot, and oh, we don't even need to talk about the throwing mechanic. If you don't grab the person you're trying to throw perfectly, you won't be able to throw them a foot.

Posted: October 1,"This game is a blast. Review bombing is a plague. The developer released a thoughtfully worded response to the online offline issue. If you're complaining about loot boxes, literally shut up. Cosmetics have and always will be the way games support continued development. The other option is a subscription model, like everything else in the world, see SaaS in the business world.

It's constantly the same games over and over and it's getting boring pretty quick. Please just get rid of the voting and have it randomized or something. TBH in the voting there's only the same to vote on as well. There are so many maps and I only really ever see 4 of them. A daily challenge would be fun too instead of just the weekly. Challenges make a game more fun, having to wait a week is meh for something like that to reset is no fun.",32.4 hrs on record,Recommended
Posted: October 1,"This game sucks. Everything is 50/50. I will hit a player with the most gut wrenching punch only for it to do ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and have them knock me out with the weakest tap possible. Another stupidly unreliable mechanic is the grabbing system. Sometimes you pick things up, sometimes you don't. Even when I take a good 5 seconds to try and pick up an item, I end up grabbing it with one hand (does not let you use the item if this happens), or I don't grab it at all. Same with trying to throw people off the map. Sometimes you can pick them up, sometimes you can't. It is incredibly frustrating. Some items are just completely broken and will eliminate players with the slightest touches (nun-chucks). Also, the kill feed options (log, banana, bomb), they are all super delayed when you click them and its again, another 50/50 shot, on whether the item you have chosen even lands on the map or gets flung off entirely. I was hoping to have fun whilst playing this game, but I only found myself angry after every match. Seriously, do not get this. Refunded after 2 hours.",9.7 hrs on record,Not Recommended

Posted: September 30,"It's hilarious to play with friends. It's a very well put together game in today's gaming world and that's saying a lot. Did not run in to any issues or bugs. But within 30 minutes while playing, the more you'll see everything is the same with a different name or object to throw or drag around. The same goes for Duo mode. Throw some one off of X to win, same concept for all those mini-games but comes around to becoming the same thing overall. Hitting enemies is very wonky, you're going to miss a lot and you'll never be able to hit the AI at all, but they'll own you like it's nothing. I can hit my friends easily, but when it comes to hitting the AI, nope. My friends and I did everything in two hours. Yes, we laughed a lot, that's what counts; but, I cannot recommend this because it's one of those games you'll play once and never play again.

Posted: September 30,"Wow, anyone giving this game a bad review either have no friends to play with or are completely full of s***. This game is fantastic fun. I can maybe understand being upset about your server ping. It's not a high budget game so I'm sure server allocation isn't exactly something they could just spring for world wide like COD. Would be nice to have an app or way for you to figure out if your server ping is good in your relocation prior to buying the game but them's the breaks. Those folks, I genuinely feel for. But everyone else b**ching about the microtransactions ... bruh, you're are acting like this game f**ked your girl and made you watch. I get it, no one wants microtransactions in a game they paid full price for, but this developer also isn't making it a pay to win scenario or anything other than, ""if you don't want to wait and earn it, here's a shop.""

It's far less predatory than a ""free"" game like Fortnite where you have to pay upwards of 20$ PER skin. This game does allow you to purchase skins yes, but a very large portion of the skins can be EARNED without that much grind. Just play the game and have fun and you'll definitely get a skin you like. Also buying skins is way cheaper than most competitors. It's a great game to play with friends, really fun once you get the hang of the controls.",23.7 hrs on record,Recommended

But when I hit someone with the might of zeus they are fine. Games a joke and this trend of games that are paid for and hiding skins behind paywalls is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ obscene and im sick of it. Gaming is truly dead. Developers make more and more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ games for more money and less game. The pure randomness of the mechanics of this game are a joke. Dont even get me started about team games. There is no way to filter out these games they are in the map pool no matter what unless you choose a custom game. You should be able to choose if you wanna play the rumble mode or the team mode. It is insanely frustrating when you get a team game and the teams are just stacked. This game needs to serious work put into it until it can be considered a good game. It is fun and wacky but the cons out way the pros at the moment. Wait for it to go on sale so you can just play it with some buddies because thats where this game truly shines. Also, let me add there is no anti-cheat for this game. So, there are a lot of cheaters.

I play from Siberia, where pings are usually not the best but for this game everything works very well.

I can basically tell you nothing bad about this game that would make it deserve a negative review. Yes, people are upset at the micro transactions, from someone who didn't spend any real money for the in-game money, i've earned over 30 skins/outfits with roughly 40 hours of gameplay. This game is 110% worth the $20 and the people leaving negative reviews because of the micro transactions have no more than a couple hours played and just want all the skins asap.

Multiplayer is great, pick between game controller 🎮 or keyboard/mouse for controlling, bright vivid graphics, small file size download, constant laughing, maps change from sporting type team match, last man standing, and team death match. If you've been buy game after game with same old game play style as previous games own buy Party Animals for something new and different with fast-paced fun, exciting matches, and best of all there's no cheater.",15.1 hrs on record,Recommended

Why would you ever want to play this offline? In fact, I think it would be terrible offline, you kinda need the whole screen to play this. Microtransactions a problem? Then don't buy them, it's completely cosmetic and you unlock cosmetics as you play, so that's a non-issue. So if you're looking to play something with your friends online or even just randos along the lines of a 3D Smash Bros, sans character special abilities, this game is completely worth the $20.",29.1 hrs on record,Recommended

Posted: September 26,"The game itself is very fun if you play it with friends or without. It is quite funny, any K.O hit is absolutely brutal, me and my friends can have countless hours of fun playing either quick match or customs. The biggest gripe for me though, is the achievements. Some of them are simply easily or a nice little challenge to get...I know some games make these achievements a grind to get so you feel some sense of gratification, a game like this however, i don't feel as should have such hard achievements. Most to all require you to do it in quick match which you can go in with a party of 4 to make your life a little easier, but to get 4-7 other people to either cooperate, or k.o so you can then go for them is quite difficult, hell its hard enough as it is to get friends to not throw anything or knock each other out. The one achievement has you survive on a plane that ices over and you have to survive 2:30, and even when you get the people to cooperate, that challenge is damn near impossible. I just hope they tweak the achievements at least a little bit...Other than that the game is very fun overall 7/10.",28.2 hrs on record,Recommended

Posted: September 26,"I've been following the development of this game since the very start when it was codenamed 'Happy Happy Nemo'. I was so glad when it was officially announced and I was hyped to buy and play it. Until I was met with a quick match that was restricted to teams only, no 8-man Free-For-Alls, instead, I got 2v2v2v2 and let's face it. Who is playing this game solo to play teams. I get the game is supposed to be played with friends and all that but the game should be able to be fun without them. The fact that you can't change the quick match search settings and are stuck to voting for a mode which will ALWAYS BE TEAMS (2v2v2v2 or 4v4) annoys the hell out of me. Also don't forget how the microtransactions are in your face, especially the fact that there are lootboxes and in-game currency obtainable by buying them. You'd think that the progression in a 20 dollar party game would allow you to buy all the cosmetics with only cookies with the option to buy cookies if you really wanna buy a skin immediately but I guess not. I'll re-buy it when they make good changes to the game because I really do wanna see this game thrive.",1.6 hrs on record,Not Recommended

The many different stages and game modes keep you engaged and the 8 player cap makes it just enough mayhem but without getting crazy like fall guys for example (something about that much people and lag makes it less enjoyable for me). You can definitely progress the game and get avatars and cosmetics without spending another dollar, and there's enough of those I think. There IS a lot to buy don't get me wrong, which bothers me a bit because I usually enjoy seeing a lot more rewards for my progress in game but overall I don't think they're abusing players by paywalling all customization, just saying. Would be nice to have more servers in other parts of the world so people don't play in >100ms latency like in South America and Oceania but I read somewhere here that they did blunder a bit and running this thing is rather expensive so I wouldn't hold my breath on that one or buy it expecting that they expand it to other regions soon. 8/10.",32.1 hrs on record,Recommended

You can't see what button is highlighted when you're selecting with a controller, the UI is slow and chunky and it's hard to figure out how to do certain things, like add a second player split screen. But the store is front and center! Also you can play local splitscreen, but you have to be online for it, and you can't play with other players online, you can only play against AI in custom games. Also you don't earn any xp or currency when you're playing in custom games, so if you're playing local splitscreen don't expect to unlock anything.

Posted: September 25,"The review bombing is AWFUL and UNNECESARY. This game is EXTREMELY FUN! I had to examine reviews before purchasing but I'm glad I bought the game. It's like Gang Beasts and Fall Guys had a baby. SOME of the game modes are like Fall Guys and some are like Gang Beasts but 90% of the levels are there own thing and make for some involving game play. People expected an ""offline play"" but be patient the game only came out recently and besides this game is MEANT FOR online play anyway. I definitely recommend getting this game as its super fun, involving and interactive. Everyone can decide what map they want and are allowed to vote on it. The only bad thing is leaving a game has a penalty but other people can join in mid-way through a match making it a unnecesary punishment. The game is already getting sponsors and skins! The devs are interacting with the community having already numerous fan-made skins. Don't listen to the negative reviews.

Posted: September 25,"This game is fire. If you like Gang Beasts you should totally get this. Even if you don't like gang beasts or know what Gang Beasts is, you should get this. A lot of people are complaining about microtransactions, but they aren’t that bad. Yes, you can buy currency, but you can also earn it in the free “battle pass” like system. Sometimes items in the shop will cost actual money, but like just don’t buy them. You can get plenty of skins by just playing. And don’t act like you wouldn’t want to make money if it was your game. Input latency doesn’t even exist (for me at least). The only problem is no offline play, but multiplayer is super fun. And I’m sure offline play will be added in the future. I played for 7 hours straight and didn’t get bored. 10/10",19.6 hrs on record,Recommended

Only downsides is that it doesn't have an offline co-op mode like originally promised (would be great to play at parties) it's just online-only, not Steam Deck compatible yet, and how some of the micro transactions cost more than the base game. But overall for a $20 game its great. I highly recommend buying and can't wait for what the future of this game has in store.",38.9 hrs on record,Recommended

For those who don't have friends (L), you can join there discord and be a part of a fun, decently nice, community. While it isn't the best game, it is very fun and for at least a good while, not repetitive (In my opinion). I understand that people have their frustrations with the game, I have my fair share of dislikes as well, but it is still an overall fun game! I personally think it is best to start playing with a friend if possible, so you can learn together. I also recommend watching videos by ""@ScoobyYTT"" on YouTube for tips when you are starting, or when you just need some extra help. In conclusion, party animals is a pretty good game. It is very fun with friends, and has a large (mostly) friendly community around it. If you have the $20 dollars to spend, I recommend using it on this game.",42.3 hrs on record,Recommended

Make the items break after like 3 or 4 hits, last thing that i don't like is how you can team kill yeah its funny but it can be really annoying at times if its like duos and they throw you off.

Posted: September 25,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

Posted: September 25,"This game has some awesome fun to be had with friends, however... the knockout mechanics are odd to say the least. They are extremely inconsistent. Someones i punch someone in the face and it knocks them out, sometimes it does not, and sometimes the knockouts last 3 seconds, sometimes they last 10+ seconds. The raw inconsistency of the core game play mechanic, makes this game extremely frustrating. Although this can be annoying, the amount of crazy funny things that can happen are high, and the ""after death"" mechanics are absolutely great. Throwing an item from the dead to knock out a friend is super funny and tossing a bomb into the mix of a small map creates some good moments.",1.4 hrs on record,Recommended

On the other hand, there is a very prevalent cash shop that I have a gut feeling the creators will focus on spending the majority of their resources into. This game will die if there is no new content added, the amount of maps currently on hand isn't exactly a bunch. On top of that, I'd say about 40% of the maps feel almost like a slog to complete (looking at you hockey, soccer, football). I want more maps with more chaotic events happening, mix that with creative backdrops and you really can't go wrong. Look at Gangbeasts, that game is perfection with how it handled its maps.

Posted: September 24,"(at the time of making this review 9/24) I'm very neutral about this game. its not bad, but I've played better rag-doll fighters, the problem is, some maps when you get knocked out of the ring the climbing is inconstant, you'll sometimes get out on the first try and sometimes you won't. but sometimes when you do, theirs someone waiting for you to knock you back down. Someone has a two handed weapon? don't try to get near them unless other people are. weapons don't break so they can keep spamming them unless its the nun chucks then there's a chance that they'll knock themselves out but it doesn't happen often, and when it does your already dead. So far there is no queue for certain game modes or teams, so you have to get lucky that 1 outta 3 maps are the one you wanna play. most of the half of the modes are 4 teams of 2, so maps feel really cramped at times. if they added an option for 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, or 4v4 then you wouldn't have three other teams to worry about. this game is just at the name says PARTY animals, it's still fun to play, but it really shines when you play with friends where as quick play, it's just yourself unless you get a friend. When you're by yourself you can get a rageful teammate who tries to knock you out when you accidentally knock them out because most people don't communicate with each other, and it's very annoying/ difficult to see who your teammate is because they will have their small name as your team color, it would be nice if they had an outline or showed who your teammate is when selecting the animal so you know what they look like. this game has only been out for less than a week so everything i said will/ might change and so will my opinion about this game, I might like it more, I might like it less. If you are thinking of buying it go ahead but play with friends for the time being. If you don't have any friends then i recommend waiting, making friends, or playing custom games. 6/10 because with friends it's fun.",5.8 hrs on record,Recommended

Yes the game does have micro-transactions...HOWEVER they are very reasonably priced. Assuming you strictly buy the premium currency (which you can earn through gameplay by the way), it basically equates to $1USD per gacha roll. Those are...the CHEAPEST rolls I've seen in existence, so to those complaining about prices...go play Genshin impact where you literally need to sell a kidney for anything in that game. Ignoring that though, you can also get GREAT outfits through achievements. Also another LIE I'm seeing in this review section is that this game has a ""battle pass"". That's also not true. They're simply level up rewards you get for FREE with no premium track or anything.",32.5 hrs on record,Recommended

While I can't confirm its performance on lower-end systems, my experience on standard hardware was smooth and optimised. Playing with friends is where Party Animals truly shines with its online multiplayer options, delivering hours of hilarity. And for those times when you want to go solo, you can still join in on the multiplayer action online, making it just as entertaining. Micro-transactions are cosmetic only, and you can earn in-game currency through gameplay. I hope the developers stay consistent with updates because Party Animals has the potential to be a long-term favourite, offering a lighthearted and laughter-inducing gaming experience that's hard to beat.",51.9 hrs on record,Recommended

There are some weapons that are too OP, when you go to pick up someone and toss them off the map, it is not easy to do. This game feels like gang beasts and fall guys had a baby, and unfortunately it is not as fun as either of those games. I was hoping that I would really like this game, but it really says something when you and all your friends in VC all say at the same time- ""Man, this game sucks.""

Now that out of the way I have 1 big complaint personally, which I SERIOUSLY feel there needs to be different playlists or something. Genuinely I am getting tired of the sports modes, I found them to be the most absolute boring modes right off the bat, but it's made even worse when they tend to be the most voted modes. Like if I'm being honest, I don't see what players like about them, but at the same time sure they're fun to others, that's great, but I seriously don't want to play them.

When you level up by playing the game (you level up by winning OR losing) you get rewards such as more skins, money and the in game currency milkbones (and not just 10 when something costs 600, I'm talking you get 1500 when something costs 600, so everything is very much free with the purchase of the game, it just takes time).

I have played Boomerang-Fu and gang beasts and this is the kind of competitiveness that makes you want to try and win but even if you lose you still have a blast!

Not a big deal, but if I play with a party, I want to play with them not only to enjoy the game togehter but earning xp, too.

Posted: September 22,"After playing the beta for a little as well as the base game. I had a great time overall and i would say it is worth the $30 if you got the money. Most negative reviews are from people in Oceania and Africa since the servers are awful in terms of ping. But if you live in the US or Europe, then this is a good buy. I also see a lot of people with issues on the monetization and although some of the prices are just plain stupid. overall its not a big issue since the the nemo bucks, which is the ingame money that is monetized, is quite easy to gain from just leveling up. I mean i got a legendary cosmetic from this game without spending a cent. The gameplay itself is sooo much fun. The best way i could describe this game would be by calling it a better Gang Beasts. Although the controls are a little annoying, i still have a great time. The first time i player this game i was crying because of all the funny crap that happens. So i would say this game is worth the price, and if you have friends that want to play then this is a great party game.

Although the offline mode was essential, I don't think it's for the best to prevent people from buying the game with bad reviews. If developers decide to include offline mode, it will probably require a lot of work and MONEY, which they won't get with so many bad reviews. I don't think it will affect us right now either, as long as servers are kept healthy. The thing that worries me is the future of the game.

Totally understand that english isn't the dev's first language, but thats a pretty big error to make. They really needed more people to proof read the description if they accidentally promised a feature they never planned to include. Hoping the game makes changes to how it's handled!

Posted: September 22,"Super fun game!! People are complaining about the monetization but it is so much better than most games, you can earn all currency types just by playing, and the only thing you need the currency for is if you want cosmetics. The graphics are super cute and there's a ton of variety in the games. Also the report button actually works which is great so you can stop people from naming themselves slurs haha. I've had the game for two days at this point and I have already won a ton of currency and skins just by playing, so if you don't want to spend real money you really don't have to, other than purchasing the game of course, but $20 for a finished game compared to the wave of half done games for $60+ that have been released lately is great. Also I find the surprise eggs fun! I'd rather do that instead of buying from the shop because it's fun, and there's a chance you'll get way more than the coins are worth. If you don't like the surprise eggs then guess what you can not click the button, I know it's mind blowing, but you have free will and you can not spend money if you don't want to spend money. You earn the currency by leveling up too so just be patient and you'll be rewarded.",28.6 hrs on record,Recommended

Posted: September 22,"While the game itself is top notch from game play, to sound and environmental design, it suffers from the same thing I heavily critiqued Overwatch 2 over, with extortionate prices of skins as well as Overwatch 1 and other games back in the day for the lootbox system that the gaming industry was plagued with for years. So for personal reasons I can not and will not recommend this game. I recommend finding other means of acquiring this product if you feel like you MUST have it. Don't support things like this. It hurts the gaming industry through and through and it saddens me to see games like this take such a big step backwards after so much push back of these monetisation practices within the last couple of years. If things change for the better, I will also change my recommendation. But for now, avoid it.",13.2 hrs on record,Not Recommended

Posted: September 21,The game is extremely fun but sometimes (all the time) i rage BECAUSE THERE ARE ISSUES the issues are that u can attack people in spectator mode like that feature needs to be removed ASAP when im climbing as an example someone hits me with a fish then i die. The other issue is other people hitting me with one punch and WHEN I PUNCH THEM 30 TIMES NOTHING but its probably not to the game is probably cuz of me because it lags and then i cant react quickly. But the game it self is so fun and the charachters are good quality but they gotta make more maps they just keep adding new characters we need new maps not characters. I really like the game and why is everyone saying theres no offline co op there is just go to custom and make a lobby then plug two controllers and play on a split screen or u can play on someone elses lobby idk whats the problem?,27.7 hrs on record,Recommended

Posted: September 21,"Micro-transactions, by the time I'm writing this, are JUST for skins, skins that have no effect on gameplay what so ever and they are skins that CAN BE BOUGHT with ingame currency earned from leveling up or playing online games. Gaining XP is a bit slower playing solo, but if you're not the obsessive type that NEEDS TO EARN EVERY SKIN IN A WEEK, you'll manage JUST FINE, by just ENJOYING THE GAME. So any outrage based around THAT is being blown out of the water. If this changes? Then I'll have reason to give grievances, but as the game stands right now? They make no effect to the gameplay nor are they invasive in any way. Don't let reviews talking smack about the game, using THAT as the main point of reference for the bad review, sway you from getting it. There's a decent number of maps and different game modes to play, with more coming down the line I'm sure. Some might find the price tag a little steep for the kind of game it looks like, on the outside, but if you get enough friends together, you will have a blast everytime you boot it up. I bought 4 copies MYSELF and gave 3 of them to friends before the game even went live and I do NOT regret it in the slightest.",15.7 hrs on record,Recommended

Posted: September 21,I just started playing the game and I would say it is way better than gang beasts. It has very cute AI and very fun game modes.

Can buy skins and stuff if you want (I don't personally care for this) and if you wanted to you could play with randoms, but that's not why I bought the game tbh, it has no real value to me. I bought it to play in private lobbies with my IRLs and other friends, and it fits the bill perfectly for that. Kind of like Among Us or Goose Goose Duck in some ways.",9.4 hrs on record,Recommended
Posted: September 21,"While I recommend this fun little game, it remains a little game that lacks many options and features. Many players will definitely become bored, very quickly, and returning now and then out of a whim or when there's new content. Throughout the developer's very long and many years of development, not much has changed since the announcement, gameplay previews, and trials. There are not enough animals and customisation options are limited; additional options are locked behind an undesirable paywall, and some through progress. The map range is very limited in quick match which is the main feature. Most maps are fixed to the genre of squad battles; 2v2v2v2 while few are team based; 5v5, the latter appears more desirable during 200 hours of matchmaking (alone and play with friends in their places).",22.6 hrs on record,Not Recommended

Posted: September 21,"I'm so disappointed by Party Animals. I had hoped to be able to play local couch co-op last night but the implementation of this feature is an absolute afterthought at best. I had controllers all controlling player one, with no real understanding as to why - not had this problem in other couch games, so why this? Probably because Recreate Games' goal was to focus on a single player per game, matchmaking online model. I didn't buy this game expecting a live service model, and the always online aspect has put me off completely. This game sorely needs an offline only couch co-op mode, skipping the necessity for logging in to a server. Why? Because once this game for whatever reason dies and the servers pulled, it's completely useless like any other live service game. I sincerely hope the developers listen to their community and the criticism they've faced and make plans to rectify it. Until then this is categorically not a party game.",1.4 hrs on record,Not Recommended

But these are easy fixes (although with how long the devs took to get this game out it might be a while before they get fixed).

Good customisation, rewarding achievement system, easy to pick up controls, very satisfying knock-out and combat system, many maps and game styles, proximity and full voice chat, etc. Plus you can even still interact with the ongoing match after you've been knocked out. When you add that with quick matchmaking and rounds, you feel like you're always in the game.

Posted: September 21,"I have previously made a negative vote on party animals, the result is still the same, I still would give it a negative review, but, the reasoning has changed a lot. Before my biggest complains were as such: 1, no oceanic servers, 2: no solo mode, only team modes, and dependence on teammates, 3: Micro transactions. Now, after around 2 months of new patches, updates, etc, I will now say the game is in a better place than it was, but still suffering in many different categories. They have now added oceanic servers, allowing austrailians to finally play the game without being at such a massive disadvantage you may as well not even play, but, there is still expensive micro transactions, and there is still no solo mode. Again, only team modes makes it so if your teammate or teammate's are bad, or inexperianced, or AFK, etc, you will have a big disadvantage that is detrimental to the point of winning because you were the better player; it is sometimes similar to rolling dice, hoping for a good roll, hence, good teammates that will actually be good, and not throw the game. I would really like to see a solo mode, and honestly, once they do release a solo mode, I will likely come back to this review again, to change it to a probable positive review. Like I said before, the game has improved with many patches, and updates, giving new mechanics, a new map, more skins, challanges, more regions, etc, but, there is still the big problem of micro transactions and only team mode games. Micro transactions are typically seen in primarily free to play games, such as fortnite, and COD warzone, and various other free to play games. But, party animals is normally around 20$ US dollars, for the standard edition. But, the dev's still decided they needed many ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ microtransactions that are just as much money, to buy the game, as to get 2 lame, boring legendary skins. Once both these problems are fixed, or made easier to withstand, I will still be giving this game a negative review.",80.4 hrs on record,Not Recommended

Personally it has no impact on the way I plan to play the game. It is absolute chaos in the best way, sometimes the climbing can get a little weird but that's the only issue I've seen so far. No issues having people join my game or issues joining lobby's. Season pass is free and gives a lot of free currency and paid for currency, gives lots of skins, emotes, and avatars. It has micro transactions for outfits which I don't understand why anyone would be pissed about that...just don't spend your money on it if you don't want it lol. 10/10 will be playing this with my wife, brothers, and solo for a long time to come I can already tell.",16.8 hrs on record,Recommended

This game doesnt deserve my positive feedback quite yet, but doesnt deserve negative either... that is unless this 4v4 mode stays. I am completely aware it only happens when a team of 3 matches with another team of 3 or 4 and solos to fill in any empty spots. After this update it feels like I get a 4v4 game every 4 out of 5 games I play. And I hate it. Either make a solos playlist further dividing the multiplayer playlist, or try something else out.

Posted: September 21,"Phenomenal game that's even better with friends. You can make a private lobby as well and still level up (at a slower rate than online) while doing so if you don't want to play against randoms. Some things need tweaking like being able to one hit KO someone right off the bat with a dropkick or a sprint punch, the ranged weapons feeling too inaccurate, and when in water or the air, you are absolutely helpless to get back to a platform. Other than that, everything is great. Micro-transactions are optional for skins, but you can earn both forms of in-game currency to eventually unlock what you want. The hatred over no offline play is absurd. if you want to play with just yourself and your friends at your house, just make the aforementioned private lobby and lock it so only people with a code can join. Also, the devs don't owe you a solo experience.

The money doesn't even cost that much to purchase anyway compared to other triple a games, and at least the game isn't pay to win. Also, recreate is a BRAND NEW COMPANY.

Posted: September 21,"Some people making negative reviews have NO IDEA WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT. Let me clear some things up.

Point 2) You can earn premium currency by playing the game unlike what others are saying. You get certain amounts for certain level up milestones. Point 3) The no offline issue. I understand why people are upset about this and the description of the offline play was a bit misleading, but if I am correct you can still do couch co-op with your friends with on the same device through split screen. Honestly the hate this game is getting is kind of sad, to the point people are trying to find things to complain about, to the point of complaining about there being TOO MANY game modes.

Things I wish it had are a locker room/GYM to practice in. Cookies are pretty annoying to get as well. For the main currency you would expect to get it by just playing. You only get cookies from leveling up (Sometimes), achievements/weekly challenges, or converting payed currency into cookies. Just give me cookies for playing games. Like 150 a game and 200 for a win. No reason this game should be a paid game with F2P aspects built in.",31.7 hrs on record,Recommended

My need for purchasing supplements like creatine and tren have become completely obsolete. Walking around with a third leg has become more of a burden than a blessing. Washing it has been a struggling because of how massive and girthy it is now (a common side effect of playing Party Animals).

The game has one quick play mode, which allows you to play online with other players; there are 20 maps divided into a few modes; and a second custom mode, which gives you the ability to play any map with friends online. There are no major game-breaking bugs. As for micro-transactions, the game has micro-transactions, but they are purely cosmetic and provide no advantage. The game has three different currencies: cookies, Nemo bucks, and coins. Cookies are the free currency that you earn by playing the game and leveling up, which can be used to buy skins in the shop. Nemo Bucks are the premium currency that you buy with real money to buy skins. Nemo bucks can also be used to convert to cookies or gold coins. Gold coins have so far been used in the Gacha loot box to get skins at random.

If we preach are wants on it loud enough I am sure it can come to fruition after all other live service games have done it so in any case yha its a 8/10 its a amazing party game if you can get past the fact its a live service with the baggage that entails.,2.5 hrs on record,Recommended

Posted: September 21,"I wrote a good review one day that said this was a good game but now after playing it with friends and alone i would tell you to not waste your money on this game, the community for some reason has become super toxic and now games seem like a competition in Esports vs just a screw around game. There are no game modes to choose from if you're solo good luck having fun in this game there is no FFA and you always seem to run into the one guy that is color blind and just keeps knocking you out defeating the purpose of teams. weapons killing you is one of the stupidest thing i can imagine you would want to keep in the game you just get people who pick up the shovel and swing on you until you either get knocked off or die and while talking about weapons they are highly unbalanced unless you're a pro at this game the only way to take out a weapon user is to drop kick them BUT good luck drop kicking anyone on the airplane map and the sub map or you re just gonna fly off and as for maps the maps are EXTREMELY random if you knock someone off at the beginning of the round and throw them off you just wasted your time because there is no way they will die to poison water or ice in the first 3 minutes so really you should just run around and wait until you can pick up a weapon and spam anyone to win and final point the climbing is so stupid on one map you can climb like a goat and the next you can barely hold on and jump up TL:DR just another game that's extremely unbalanced and devs that will just assume they know how to balance the game by doing nothing right so save that 20$ for another game that wont piss you off",35.1 hrs on record,Not Recommended
