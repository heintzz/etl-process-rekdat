Punches miss, rolling sucks, and every attack is dropped to such a ridiculous amount of accuracy. Whats even dumber is they've added a new mechanics for 'Losers' to peg stuff at other players as a way to be an annoying sore loser.

Posted: November 14,I would still recommend this to most especially since online only isnt a huge deal for a vast majority of players unless you were sold on it from the start with false promises which I can totally understand. This is definitely a huge step up from a game like Gang Beasts gameplay wise and it even has a somewhat decent progression system on top although it is pretty grindy which is annoying.,8.8 hrs on record,Recommended

Posted: November 14,"TLDR: Fun with friends, frustrating mechanics, bad game company. Is the game fun with friends? Sure. But this game is enraging. I didn't have any expectations coming into the game so unlike most the reviews, I don't care about the loot boxes that much or lack of offline mode but it seems like big corporation screwed over loyal backers. My problem with this game lies with some of the mechanics. The maps without a insta-kill zone are extremely inconsistent. For example the gas map I will watch some people spend 5 to 10 seconds slowly getting back to the platform and survive. This precedes to happen 4 times and the person still survives. Meanwhile I had a match where about 3 seconds into the match I was thrown in the gas and preceded to die seemingly instantly. Along with this, the hit registration is inconsistent as well. I will watch my powered up punches slam into someones face 4 times with no knockout, then get one hit by something that didn't even look like it hit me. Also the power punch is only thrown from the right hand which is a small detail that I think should change as there are many times I wish he would just throw the left hand instead. Most people would boil this down to skill issue which is fine, its my review, and I prefer my games to have a sense of control and consistency which this game completely lacks. If you don't care about that than yeah the game is great fun. My last grievance is that once you reach lvl 100, I don't see a way to gain nemo bucks which means your only option is to buy their premium currency to buy loot boxes to hope to get the skin you want. For a 20 dollar game, this business practice is pathetic. The amount of nemo bucks you earn from leveling up and achievements just isnt enough to get the skins you want and they know that. They just want you to spend more money to gamble and hopefully find the skin you want.",22.6 hrs on record,Not Recommended

Posted: November 5,"I can't recommend this game to anybody who's colorblind, just cause of how difficult it is to distinguish who's green and who's yellow (common to hear this is randos as well). I can only speak for red-green Deuteranopia sight, but I'd imagine Protanopia is pretty awful as well. I'm still going to play it, but given how quick a fix this is that would affect ~5%-10% of males, it's apparent that the bare min for accessibility wasn't considered outside of button remapping.",34.3 hrs on record,Not Recommended

Posted: November 4,"For the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease 2 8-inch round cake pans. Line with parchment paper, then butter/spray with cooking a medium size bowl combine the flour, sugar, unsweetened cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Set the bowl of a stand mixer (or use a hand held mixer) beat together the eggs, buttermilk, greek yogurt, canola oil and vanilla until smooth.Slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients with the mixer on low until there are no longer any clumps of flour. Add the hot coffee and mix until combined. Batter should be pourable, but not super thin. Stir in the chocolate chips, if using.Pour the batter among the 2 cake pans and bake 20 to 25 minutes, until the tops are just set and no longer wiggly in the center. Remove and let cool five minutes, then run a knife around the edges of the pan. Grab 2 large flat plates, line them with wax or parchment paper and invert the cakes onto the paper lined plates. Cover and let the cakes cool completely before frosting.For the Frosting: Add the butter and powdered sugar to the bowl of a stand mixer (or use a hand held mixer). Beat the butter and powdered sugar together until the butter is light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add the cocoa powder and vanilla and beat, scrapping down the sides as needed another 2 minutes or until there are no streaks of white. Add 3 tablespoons of the heavy cream and whip the frosting for 2-4 minutes or until light and fluffy. If desired add the remaining tablespoon of the heavy cream (I normally do) and whip until combined. Taste the frosting and add more powdered sugar if you like a sweeter or thicker frosting.Place 1 layer, flat side up, on a plate or cake stand. With a knife or offset spatula, spread the top with frosting. Place the second layer on top, rounded side up, and spread the frosting evenly on the top and sides of the cake. Decorate with sprinkles, chocolate curls or whatever your heart desires. *To quickly bring eggs to room temperature place them in a bowl and fill with warm water. Let them sit five minutes.",8.8 hrs on record,Recommended

The game needs a knockout ring timer or some form of understanding as to why there's so much inconsistency with knockouts. This inconsistency spreads elsewhere, one second I'm tossing someone in the ice and they swim for a good 3 seconds, climb up, get knocked down in the water and are able to climb out once more, then if I get pushed off within those 3 seconds I'm froze, there are many examples of this and it makes the game very unfun when at its core it's a pretty enjoyable party game with some really fun games, but it's just too much, maybe in future updates......but I have a weird feeling that this is something that'll remain very much the same game with no major QoL changes or updates made but I'd like to be wrong and I'd like to change my review if those things happen along with it.",54.5 hrs on record,Not Recommended

Posted: October 27,"At first I was hesitant spending $20 on a game from a new Dev team and also seeing the negative reviews. Do NOT listen to the negative reviews. This is gang beast on steroids. No pay for skins bs (like alot of games nowadays), you unlock skins, bones and dollars so fast it actually gives you the ability to use the item shop without having to spend irl money. Playing online is really great, haven't faced any connection issues. The game mechanics are great, not perfect, but still really good. 2 minute timeout makes sense. You leave a game YOU started, you are gonna get a timeout. If you can't wait 2 mins you need to learn how to have patience. Solid game worth the $20. Split screen is a little wonky, I won't lie but this is the early 2000's with LAN parties anymore. I get the complaint but it still works. Solid game all around 8.3/10",25.9 hrs on record,Recommended

Posted: October 27,"As much as everyone harps about the micro transactions. It's what you make of the game. 70hrs in level 90, played with friends and solo mostly. 80k non-pay to win currency and 5k nemo bucks. Have gotten all IP collab skins. Although I can feel the need to speed YOU simply do not have too. The game itself is enjoyable without getting ALL the skins. Pick a few you like and enjoy! Only negative harp about it, the dam nunchucks are kinda OP.",93.4 hrs on record,Recommended
